I don't care Young Master Look at this umbrella! Master! It's nice, huh? Did you buy it? No You found it? You're excited No I was on my way to the West Lake I was caught in the rain I ran into a lady while taking shelter She gave me the umbrella You don't have to get so excited It's worth nothing, but means a lot Even if it's pouring I won't get wet The lady who gave me this is from a distinguished family Who is it? On the night of the lantern festival I met Huang Bi Jun at Master Lu's The one you talked about yesterday? Yes Huang... what's the name? Huang Bi Jun! What a coincidence! A Miss Huang from the western part of the city There's a pair of stone lions outside her door Stone lions? Stone lions! The Huangs? What are you thinking? I'm thinking When your father was alive You were engaged to a Miss Huang from the western part of the city That's right! Your mother told me When they exchanged the betrothal gift We offered a precious mirror In return The Huangs sent a coral tree Yes! The coral tree is indeed at home What if Miss Huang is my fiancee? Master, then what will you do? Well? When the engagement was agreed Your father still held office Now that he's dead You have not made contact The connection died with your father As for the engagement It may not be The world is full of snobbery It's hard to say Now that you have brought this up I must find out if she's the one What if they renege? What will you do? I'll sue them Don't be silly They're rich and powerful Before you file your complaint You'll be beaten up first Forget about it! Mirror polish! Do you need to polish mirrors? You know how? Yes! You really know how? Of course! Come in! What's wrong with you? Stop staring! Follow me! Put it down! Wait here! I'll get the mirror This is the backyard Stay where you are Yes...

You're supposed to polish the mirror how could you break it? This is ridiculous! The mirror was a part of the family hairloom How can you pay for it? Sir How could you entrust such a precious mirror to someone like him? It's not my fault It's Yi Chun... Did you bring out the mirror? I did Sister! I caught you! What are you doing here? Wu Niang Why are you hiding in there? Father Who wanted the mirror to be polished? I told Yi Chun to bring out the mirror Really...

Not so easy? If you don't pay for it I'll send you to jail I don't have any money That won't do any good Get my name card Father, the mirror is broken Sending him to jail is useless Even if I don't I can't spare him I'll work for you And pay for the mirror Work as a servant? Yes... Look at you... You can't do any chores If I let you stay I'd be wasting food instead No... What? I can cook and clean I can also read and write Really? Yes Alright The mirror was a valuable heirloom You'll sell yourself as a page boy for 3 years! Agree?
