foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- BUDAPEST POLICE HEADQUARTERS 2 million people live in this city. 4 people per day commit suicide or die under unclear circumstances or in accidents. We investigate these unusual deaths with administrative procedures. Only 2 percent are proven to be the result of foul play. But last week, 3 such cases occurred, which extends way beyond the statistical margin of error. 2 of these are my cases, and one case has already been closed by our colleagues. Here, the victim didn't pull the handbrake, and his own jeep ran over him in the garage under the sloping driveway. We closed the case. The circumstances are clear. The bloody print of the back wheel is obvious. The front wheel isn't bloody yet. That's what ripped open the abdominal wall. If he'd simply been run over once, the abdominal wall would only have torn on the forward direction side. The photo shows that the blood and intestines spilled in both directions. So the wounds are nearly symmetrical. The back wheel went over him twice: Once in reverse and once forward. This victim was murdered. - Sorry, boss, duty calls. We gotta go. - Just a minute. Éva, you just sit in the basement. Never go out to the crime scene. Designated unfit for investigation. This is a closed case. You say your colleagues haven't done their job right? No. But here, the dog's teeth marks... Éva, this is absurd. All doors and windows were closed. Locked. How could another dog appear at the scene? You question our professional opinions. Is this seriously why I had to come here? - But the details show... - Fuck the details! You opened an officially closed case without permission! You're just like your husband! I'll bet you have a conspiracy theory. Close your own case by tomorrow morning. And forget this case. Or start looking for a new job. The boss was pretty harsh with you. He's the new colleague on Homicide. He came from the countryside. He wants to talk to you about your cases. - I have to go now. - OK. Call me if you need any help. Where is it? Where is it? Fuck. Look, Éva, I'm only trying to help you. Following 90 days of non-payment, we have to auction off your apartment. So, you must pay your mortgage debt within 3 days. I hope you can manage, but please try at least. Kati is one of our most talented students, but she might lose her full scholarship with such bad behavior. Unfortunately. We begin disciplinary procedures tomorrow. You have to sign the report. - It's not nice to make rude comments. - They said my father... Whatever they say, you cannot break their nose. Marcella's father is the deputy mayor. I convinced him not to press charges. She suffered serious injuries. You don't need me to explain. It won't happen again, right? Kati, wait inside. We'll be right with you. Do you deal with speeding tickets? No. Do you know somebody who does? Never mind. This was Kati's last strike. Let's go in and sign the report. Where is it? Where is it? Demonstrations continue. The angry mob tried to block police intervention with barricades. Though the crowd broke up by dawn, demonstrations continue today. Here. They demand the prime minister's resignation. The leader of the opposition stated: He agrees with... Next time they pick on you, just ignore them. The disturbances ended in 44 injuries and 1 death. The 32 year-old... Did you hear me? You can't break everybody's nose. If you'd look a bit more normal, they'd pick on somebody else. I'm invisible and boring as it is... like you, and your toast sandwiches. That's not why they pick on me. They said... dad was corrupt and... killed himself. Why didn't you tell me? Why did I have to find out from my classmates? You think that's normal? Give me your pants. I'll wash them. Who cares about my pants? He killed himself, right? Why?! Why?! Say something! I hate that you're like this! He killed himself because he couldn't stand you either! Foul play: Ruled out. Investigation procedure initiation: None. Do you have your sandwich? Do you have your sandwich? Éva Batíz? Please, get in. You have to come with me. - Go on. - Bye. They say she's completely nuts. The oldest profession, five letters... She and her husband were the best detectives I knew. I wonder if she'll find something. Look, Richie... Winks... doesn't wink... winks... doesn't wink. - You're messing with me, right? - Uh-huh. Shit. I'd like you to look at the scene. Self-hanging. What's the matter? Just send me the photos. If you prove this was a murder, I'll check the three cases you talked about yesterday. I'm here with you. I'll help. I had the corpse removed, like you asked. Trust me. Just tell me what I missed. - Did you get this already? - Uh-huh... Hi. What's the first question you ask? Tell me. - Suicide note? - None. Next. What seems off here? There's work to be done, Éva. Come on. - Was this hers? - Yes. - I'm done. Bye. - Okay. - How did she climb up there? - Maybe asked somebody to help. This isn't proof yet. We got this far too. 267... 81cm... - The lady from the neck down? - I know! 164 centimeters. 45cm. That's 263 in all. We're missing 4cm. If she was on tiptoes, that covers it. - A lady with a cane? - That's still self-hanging. How heavy was she? 60kg? About that. Push it down, please. 40... that's 5cm more. Thanks. Now we're missing 9cm. They hung her on the gas pipe... put a toppled chair under her... But didn't count on the chair cushion denting. Bingo. You see, I need you... and your folder. The dog bit off his finger? No, that's a very old truncation. What makes you think it was murder? The gap between two zipper teeth is 6mm. The gap between two fang marks on the wound is 6.6cm. This is Feri's coat. The diameter of his button is 3cm. The gap between the fangs of the victim's dog is 4cm. This person was killed by a much larger dog. Okay, not bad. But we'd need to take the dog's bite sample. It got put to sleep already. And do you know how the other dog got into the locked house? Why don't the photos make you panic? These are just pictures. You can't get away with breaking my sister's nose. Just sayin'. She's even flat-chested. There are no clues. Let's work. We have no time to panic. There's no trace of forced entry. Look around. C'mon. Help. I've seen everything on the photos. Then look at what they didn't photograph. Where's the attic door? When did he die? 4 days ago. When we had that big storm. The killer got in here... let his dog in from the yard. The dog killed the old man, he put the dog outside, climbed out here, and they left together. I've seen this footprint before. What if these cases are connected? The boss will be really angry. I'm not angry! Through the roof? Goddamnit. Fucking hell! I need a team. What team?! There's no team here! The city's in ruins. 17 colleagues in the hospital... There'll be lots of overtime work too. You want to ruin my statistics? In an election year? I get my ass kicked enough from above! Now you bring 4 new homicide cases?! This is all your fault! No. It's mine. What if the press finds out? And if they find out we're covering up murders, and the cases are related? What makes you think that? Are you blackmailing me?! I just need three weeks. You get two weeks. If you don't find anything you go back to the countryside. Get out of here! I'll get you a desk in our office. Don't worry... just focus on your breathing. You know what? Count every breath you take. Count to ten. Then start again. Please don't. Okay. Just count. We'll be done soon. One... Left hand... ring finger... She could've been injured before they threw her out. Or while she was gardening. In the middle of the forehead... Count. One... And this? Two... What would it prove? She was knocked down and thrown out? Exactly. She fell on her back. This injury is not in the autopsy records. I don't believe it. Show me. Do you rule out that she was hit on the head and thrown out? - Answer me! - Six... Didn't you learn manners? - Answer me! - Seven... Yes, she might have been knocked down and thrown out. - Eight... - Are you happy now? Nine... Footage from security cameras. I think I'll be spending the night here. - Call logs, bank statements? - I've asked for them already. Witnesses? None. A lot of shoe brands have such soles. This isn't a clue we can follow right now. Shit! Professor? We can't rule out that it was the same perpetrator. Probably male. He tries to disguise the murders. May suffer from dissociative personality disorder. We'll protect the country... protect families... protect the future of our children. We need safety and unity in order to finally gain the advancement of our nation... He's unable to fit into society. Believes himself to be omnipotent, almighty. He imagines unlimited power, feels no empathy for anyone. Doesn't love, feels no anxiety, does not learn. This country is our home. Faith - trust - future. The National Union Party. The elderly victims might allude to him being raised outside a family. He projects his personal grievances onto the world. Creates ideology to go with his killings. Athletic, muscular. Feels like he has unlimited rights. A right to kill. He will continue until he is caught. Mom, I can't believe this. You sewed up my pants? I told you we knock before entering a room. - They ripped, so I sewed it. - But that's how I liked it! All the light switches in a row! Grilled cheese every night! Half an hour of TV per day, and not a word about Dad! That's how you want it! Cause those are your damned rules, right?! I've never even seen a picture of him... I threw them out. He left us and we don't talk about him. Nothing. No gunpowder traces. But a lot of rope marks. The head would've surely dropped to one side from the shot's impact. They arranged his head in a vertical position for some reason. Everything okay? Uh-huh... - Do you establish foul play? - This wasn't suicide. And they didn't try to disguise it either. Catch the bastard. Five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... I want to know all the tiny details. Anything might be useful. Feri: Taxi companies, police, ambulance. - Was there anything odd last night? - OK. We must return to the earlier crime scenes. "Betrayal of the intelligentsia." What the fuck is this? CORRUPTION "Corruption." - Congratulations. How did you know? - It was on a forensic photo. And where's your panic disorder? "Exploitation of political power to gain economic influence." "Xenophobia. Incitement of negative sentiments against Gypsies and Jews." "Offshoring and bad privatization." Betraying the intelligentsia. Xenophobia. Incitement of negativity towards Gypsies and Jews. 6 Points of Political Betrayal: CALL DETAILS Can somebody explain what's going on? We have a suspect. He uploaded his points a year ago. A fucking terrorist? He left one of his points at the last crime scene. He wanted us to find it. - What for? - His list got 31 likes. Maybe he wanted more attention. He wants us to catch him. It's common with psychopaths. - We found fingerprints on the papers... - which were not in our database. We have 5 victims so far, but 6 Points on his list. He might kill again. His username's been active for 4 years. Soon we will locate him by his IP address. Richie! What the fuck is this... "exploined?" - Exploited. - What the fuck is that?! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! Strange. I checked the victims' call logs. I found a number which called all of them. - I called it, but it didn't ring in there. - And? Now it's busy all the time. Nobody's stupid enough to call their victims from their own number. Maybe it's a public phone. I'll check this number. Look... Shit. C'mon, we'll catch him! Come on. Stop... Stop... Are you scared? Are you really so scared? On your knees! Hands behind your head! Now! Cover me. Everything okay? Fucking hell! Help me! Goddamnit, help me already! You really are fucking dangerous. C'mon, do it! Quit wasting time! This is all you got, coppers! Motherfuckers! We won't give up, even if you lock us all up, so don't celebrate yourselves, cocksuckers! There's people who'll finish what I started. Accomplices? What else did you plan? Typical asshole law enforcement agents. Whose law are you enforcing, assholes? We do your job, impotent cocksucker! Doing it for you! And for you! Everything okay? - Who'll be the 6th? - What 6th, dickhead? 6 Points of Political Betrayal. Sound familiar? Ancient history. Why don't you ask about nursery school? So you admit to uploading the list on the net. Blow me. Never mind. It was uploaded from your computer, printed onto your paper. - What? - Your fingerprints are on the papers. - Who's the 6th victim? - Your mother. Why did you kill them? Why did they have to die? What the fuck? I didn't kill anybody. The DNA tests take a while. But I'm sure we'll have a match. We have plenty of evidence. We don't need your confession. But maybe it'll be easier for you. Go fuck your mothers, you bastards. You can't falsely accuse me. I didn't do anything. Understand? I didn't kill anybody! Motherfuckers! Something wrong? Fuck you! The address of the phone number's owner you asked for. - It's always busy... - Here are the victims' bank statements too. - Thanks. - Come on. We couldn't have done it without you. Attention please! I'm firing anybody who brings in a new case before the elections. I was told that Péter is promoted. Congrats, Major! - The first round's on you tonight! - Thanks. Thank you. Thanks so much! - Congratulations. - Richie... - Congratulations! - Thank you. Kati, you've got to eat something. You can't hide all night. It's not a toast sandwich this time. What is it then? It's a cold one. Thanks. What the fuck? Hey. What are you doing here? Honestly, it's a dream come true. A serial killer or a promotion? A partner like you. Does this pickup line work in the countryside? Sometimes it does... I see. You're the smartest cop I ever met. But there's a problem. What? Well... That you really are dangerous to me. I'm sorry about... But I like that. HOLDING CELL Don't. What's wrong? My daughter... Oh, for fuck's sake. He must've hid that fucking blade in his clothes. Yeah. Excuse me! Does Kálmán Horváth live here? I came to fix the garden just now. Mr. Horváth is abroad for 3 weeks. His phone is always busy. I can't let anyone in. But you have a key, don't you? Oh my God. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... Call an ambulance! Fiat... Lux... - Are you OK? - Yes, thank you. BANK STATEMENTS 225,000... 225,000... National Pension Institute. A broken hip, maybe his spine is injured. Completely dehydrated. Internal bleeding, pulmonary embolism. Looks like nothing is gone. Passport... plenty of money too... He must have fallen off the chair while looking in his safe. Foul play? We'll see at the autopsy. NATIONAL PENSION INSTITUTE Without a court order, I can only give you this archive. - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. Dezső Kovács, retired from Transimpex on June 24, 1989. Lilla Maros, Transimpex. Retired: June 24, 1989. Irén Koltai, Transimpex, June 24, 1989. Péter Magda, Transimpex. Kornél Németh, Transimpex... All the victims retired on June 24, 1989. Last place of employment: Transimpex. - Do you have files on Transimpex? - Uh-huh. - What kind of a company was it? - Some foreign trade company. As all the "impex" -es were. Excuse me, what does "inactive" mean? It just means they are dead. What happened to this person? Hmm, that's strange. He was erased from the system. Erased, like he'd never existed. Hello? Sándor Réczei? I am Lieutenant Éva Batíz, police department. I see... Could I meet him anyway? Sándor... Did your former colleague Kálmán Horváth call you? Tastes good. Good... You may be in danger. Your Transimpex colleagues are... dead. Transimpex... Good coffee... Give me coffee. Coffee! Give me coffee! Wicked girl! Give me coffee! Tibike! Tibi... Tibi... We solved the most brutal serial murder case of the decade. Let me introduce our newly appointed deputy head of the Homicide Department, Major Gács. Thank you. After we collected conclusive evidence, the suspect committed suicide in police custody. Can you confirm the political motive? We are not sure yet what motivated the murders. I wrote a summary of the case. So many things happened today. So... the murders were disguised as accidents or suicides. This was Plan A. Éva, it's over. It's all over. It's not over. We realized this, and then came Plan B. We were given the boy's notes on a platter, with fingerprints, then they killed him. Who would have done that? I don't know yet. All the victims worked in the same department at a trade firm in the '80s. - So what? - What if they wanted to hide this? What if they had to die because of this? Kálmán Horváth was among them. That really was an accident. Feri's writing the report. But he called all the victims for some reason. They were colleagues. Kept in touch. Pensioners' club or some shit. You want coffee? I don't drink coffee. Two of them died in the '90s. I met the ninth one recently. He's completely demented. The tenth... Demented, so he's fine. Just like the 10th I assume. Goddamn... This shit is broken. No. The 10th was wiped from all records. Maybe he knows what's going on. We must find him. We must continue investigating. You want me to look like an idiot? I just announced that we solved the case. Éva, let it go now. I'll get you a pay raise. You can solve your mortgage problem. Let's not ruin it, Éva. Don't ruin it. I've been here two weeks and already I've been promoted. You did all this to get promoted? Everybody involved in this case dies. Do you really believe that boy committed suicide - a few hours after arrest? - That's enough! It was suicide. The blade was in his pants. He was a psycho, for fuck's sake! Yes, maybe... Do you suspect someone? Me, perhaps? Or someone else? Who do you suspect? Do you hear what you're saying? I have to go now. You should go to room 205. They're waiting for you. NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS DEPUTY HEAD, HOMICIDE DEPT. PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELING Are you taking your meds? Look, your test results weren't too good. And Péter really did get in trouble because of you. You had your first panic attack after your husband's suicide... I liked Gábor too, you know... We talked about this a lot. We have to accept his death. That unsuccessful investigation, his alcohol problems, and he might have been afraid of becoming a father... He wanted a child more than anything. DEPARTMENT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME His head was positioned. As if looking at something. You need to take this medicine again. I've got a therapy group. Join us. It'll help you to realize that panic is just fear of being afraid. And you must finally face this trauma. I'm signing you off on sick leave. No. Please, don't. Don't do this. It's mandatory. Only a month, for now. You have to hand in your service weapon. Kati, look at me when I speak to you. - Sanyi, explain what happened. - It wasn't us. She's lying. Believe me. We'd never do such a thing. Ask our father. Did somebody see it? Can you prove it? If you did this to yourself to get them in trouble, you won't get away with it. "Keeping political power through violence." Éva Batíz speaking. What? I told her to make peace. The investigation was dropped. We can't punish the deputy mayor's kids... Éva! Éva! Wait, Éva! WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING IF TRUTH IS DEAD Kati. Kati, come away from there. I hate you! You and this whole school! Kati. Kati. Kati. We'll leave this place forever. Just come away. What makes you think I won't jump? Suicides don't bring sandwiches with them. Come down before I punch someone too. Róza Fogarasi, hit by a car, M.L. March 22, 1982. Róza Fogarasi. Search.

István Kolos charged with several counts of homicide committed suicide in his cell Wednesday. The Budapest man was taken into custody 2 days ago, suspected of 4 counts of homicide. N.K. - Hi, Éva. - Feri. I found the connection. All the victims worked for an undercover death squad in the '80s. They died the way they once killed. Accident, suicide. Get it? Even the scapegoat killed in custody fits. Shit! Do you have access to the central archive? - I do, but it won't be easy. - You have to help. Your place in an hour. Come on. Let's go this way. WE WANT JUSTICE! WE WANT JUSTICE! POISON Calm down. I can't understand half of what you're saying. - Is this mine? - Oh-ho! - This is for kids. - Thanks. A... hamburger... The records were swept before the change of regime. They're not in the archives. If they really were a death squad, you won't find anything about them. I had the little notebook in my hand. It contained everything. The news was in the old papers. That woman took everything, along with my bag. I have no proof. Nothing... No evidence, no case. Wait. Don't you want this cheeseburger instead? No. You are such a terrible liar... Do you know what car a Fiat Lux is? Maybe made for the American market. What is it? Nothing. I still have this from the library. It has dots marked on it. Thank you. - Yes? - Sorry to bother you so late. I got your number from Kálmán Horváth. I see. Come to my office tomorrow at 2. Sárközi Law Office. 42 Andrássy Avenue. I need a password? My client gave strict orders to only give out the deposit to someone who knows the password. And so, madam, let's not waste each other's time anymore. Fiat Lux... Fiat Lux? Let there be light. Genesis 1:3. Rózsa Street Bank. A word of advice, though. Think it over well before you open the safe. You'll find old files in an envelope. Old Internal Affairs files. But be warned. The fact that my client is dead shows how serious this case is. Where's my daughter? Look, honey... You will give it to me... And I give you my word that you will not be harmed. Where did you hide that envelope? I don't believe you. I know who you are. Perhaps you suspect a few things... You might know a few details... But I doubt you know anything. You have no idea what this envelope is. Kálmán Horváth organized a meeting with the members of our old unit. Except one. His plan was to blackmail the 10th member of our unit with his past. Kálmán Horváth wanted to blackmail a man who'd made it to the top of the food chain. We couldn't get Kálmán to tell us where he hid that damned envelope with the evidence. You're the only one who knows where it is. Éva, I hope you don't mind me saying... that you, with your panic disorder... your mortgage issues... your whole pathetic life... you're not exactly a hero. Your husband... He was completely different. With his "Petrol Case" investigation. You can easily track down a lone hero... manipulate them... or if not, you can eliminate them. As in your husband's case. Who was it? Who did it? A freelancer. He works for me at the moment. But you will tell us where the envelope is. I'm sure of it. Hi, Mom. Hi, Kati. Your colleague who picked me up is really nice... we... You see? Your daughter is perfectly safe. And this won't change if we get the envelope. Promise that you won't hurt her. Of course I won't. On the contrary... We'll take care of her. Éva... You are sick... You need psychiatric care. You could be forced into treatment in a mental clinic. And your daughter will be taken from you. You can't do that. It won't be necessary... Right? Because, honey... you're just like anyone else in this city. You live your little lives... Pay off your debts... Vote every 4 years believing you have a say... Sometimes you get angry... go to demonstrations, you shout... feel powerful. And then what happens? A big nothing. And you finally accept it. We have no business with you. You can't prove anything. Tell me where the envelope is and you'll get your pathetic little life back, and your daughter. I'm asking for the last time. Where is it? On the ground floor. At the landing, on the little cabinet. Smart girl. My friends are going there now. If you've told the truth, you have just one thing left to do. Forget this ever happened. But I warn you: We're only allowed one mistake here. The first... and the last. STATUE OF LIBERTY Fucking suicides. Making more paperwork for us.

TO THE DAILY NEWS sometimes going to demonstrations... to shout... and then nothing happens. Think it over well before you open the safe. You'll find old files in an envelope. Old Secret Service files. - Can I photocopy these quickly? - Yes. May I rent the safe for a few more weeks? Since then I've lived in terror. But it was worth it. Because at that moment, it felt good not to be afraid... - Thanks for the lift. - No problem. ARCHIVES Thank you. - Everything alright? - Yes. József Gábor Batíz July 10, 2003. Autopsy report.
