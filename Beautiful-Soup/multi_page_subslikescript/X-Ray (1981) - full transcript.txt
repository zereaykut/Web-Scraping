In fact, the symptoms are totally non-existent. Symptoms? Remember that cowboy in ward 117? All his symptoms indicated he had acute hepatic infection. And it turned out to be mumps. Christ, this is practically a fucking death warrant. Suzy, wait 'til... Hmm. (door creaking) (Nancy screaming) Somebody, anybody, help! Oh, they killed Suzy! I don't know what's happened. They killed Suzy! (Nancy gasping) (killer groaning) (bones cracking) (dramatic music) Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep you here for a while. - Why?

Old and rotten on the inside, putrid and foul. - Oh, what a pity. - I wonder what ails her? - All her bones are decaying, and her organs are all rancid. And her blood is as malignant as slime. Would you just shut up! (dramatic music) Oh, well, here she is, up and around already. I've got to get out of here, Harry. This is unbearable, I just can take anymore. All right, fine. Now, just calm down. I want you to tell me something. How long have you been Dr. Jacobs' patient? - Three years, maybe four. - Mm-hmm. And when did she last give you a check-up? Two years ago. You know what the results were like? She said I was in great shape, except that I had low blood pressure. - Nothing else. - No. Are you sure? You're not holding anything back on us, now, are you? Of course not. Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll go take a look at Dr. Jacobs' files. (ominous music) Just be cool. Now, this is highly irregular. - What are we doing? - Shh. Gonna check on something. (door opening) - Well, what about that? - What? What is it? Don't you worry, baby. We'll have you out here in an hour. (sighs) Oh, thank God. You just go back to your ward and sit tight. Well, why are they keeping me here in the first place? Dr. Saxon acts as if I'm dying or something. Don't you worry about that. You let me handle it. Somebody's trying to play a con job on you, and I wonder who it is. You just go back to your room. (knocks softly) Dr. Saxon? (phone ringing) Hello? No, no, this is Harry. Yeah, okay, I'll be right up. What floor? Fine, be right there. (car horn honking) - Hello. - Yes, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Susan Jeremy. Is she a patient?

Observation? Well, what does that mean? It means she's under observation. Well, that explains everything. Where? Okay. Around this corner, 8-B. Make it fast. - Jack! Oh! - Hey. - Oh, God. - What is all this? - They won't let me go. - Why? What's going on? They said something's wrong. - Wrong? What do you mean? - I don't know. They've been treating me as if I've got leprosy or something, except they won't tell me anything. Well, how do you feel? - I feel perfectly fine. - Look, Sue, really? I'm all right, honest. Except, I'm really worried about Eva. Tom left her alone in his apartment. She's sitting there, waiting for us. Let's get outta here. - Can you? - I don't see who's gonna stop me. Okay. Get dressed, let's go. I don't even know where my clothes are. I'll just go just as I am. You have to sign out or something? Why bother? I never signed in. (tense music) - Going somewhere? - Yes, I'm checking out. Take Miss Jeremy back to her ward, please. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'm not going back to that zoo! - You'll have a private room. - I'm - Just as soon as one is available. I don't want a private room, I want out! Out! - Come on, Miss Jeremy. Get your hands off me. Harry said I could leave. Harry did? On whose authority? Take her back to her room. Come on, you gotta go. Now, calm down. Jack! For Christ's sake! Don't just stand there! Do something! - Come on. - Jack! Wait a minute! Is this necessary? - Necessary? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Why? She's very ill. Ill? Can't you tell me anything more? Please, we're engaged. There's a bench outside of my office. Why don't you go have a seat. I'll fill you in later. (ominous music) [Male Announcer] Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? I'm the only gentleman in the hallway. Are you calling me? Of course I'm still here. I was told I could wait, so I waited. Yes. Yeah, what? Room 9117 No? Wait, I can't hear you. No, service to... right, right, I'll find him. (suspenseful music) (both scream) Jumping Christ! You scared the shit out of me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (grunts) I'm sorry. (ominous music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chanting) (spoons jingling) (clacking) - Dr. Jacobs? Dr. Jacobs? - That's not Dr. Jacobs. Why, no, it's a fine young man. Well, where is Dr. Jacobs? (suspenseful music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chattering) [Man] Over here. Come closer. Is she your mistress? I beg your pardon? [Man] Are you sleeping together? Does she let you hold her in your arms? Can you touch her wherever you like? In all her secret places? What is this, some sick joke or something? (suspenseful music) (saw buzzing) Please, help me! Please, don't! (screaming) (killer growling) (squelching) (clock ticking) (eerie music) (footsteps approaching) (Susan shrieking) Help me! Oh! Help me! Can somebody help me?

Come on, Kitty, get her outta here. Come on! Come on! - No! No! - Okay, show us where he is. - No! No! I don't wanna see him! - Come on, Susan. All right. Okay now, Susan, where is it? It's there in that box! Go on. (tense music) Go ahead, open it. So you have an unknown admirer, Susan. It was Jack's head! It was only a nightmare, Susan. The hell it was! And did they see it? They weren't here. Oh, they weren't here? It was Jack's head! No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't! I want you to stop this nonsense. Dr. Saxon, Harry got my medical chart from Dr. Jacobs' file. - He what? He said there was no reason to keep me in this goddamn hospital. He opened Dr. Jacobs' files? He said somebody's trying to con me. What'd he do with your chart? I don't know, he took it with him. All right. There are photostats of all of the doctors' files in the archives upstairs. I'll check on it in the morning. Why not right now? Go ahead, check it now! Here, Susan, take this. Thatta girl. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (heavy breathing) (sinister whispering) (lighter clatters) (elevator bell dings) (Susan screams) Give me a cigarette, huh? What are you doing sneaking around this place? I bet you're waiting for your boyfriend, huh? I'm trying to escape out of here. Hey, what's your big rush? You know, stick around. We'll have a ball.

(all struggling) Get your hands off of me. Damn it, off! What are you doing? You stupid, stupid nurse! I'm trying to tell you I just saw a murder! - This is like the last time. - What are you doing to me? You have no right to do this! (screaming) - It's for your own good. - You stupid nurse! Listen to me! You stupid nurse! Somebody killed him, he's dead! Who do you think you are? This whole hospital is nuts! Don't you people understand somebody was just murdered? Let me out of this! Please, help! - Get her hip. Help me! Help! Don't you understand somebody was just murdered? What is wrong with this hospital? - Now what? - It's another seizure. I'm not having a seizure! She said she saw someone kill Dr. Saxon with an ax. He didn't try, he killed him! Some sort of hallucinatory fit, just like the last time. It looks like a typical attack of delirium tremens. Saxon was complaining of a lack of symptoms. This is clearly symptomatic enough. What is wrong with everybody in this hospital? (Susan groaning) (Beam groans) Why don't you listen to me? I'm trying to tell you somebody was Killed tonight. Keep her under observation. If anymore of this, I'm going to have to operate. I'm trying to tell you something!
