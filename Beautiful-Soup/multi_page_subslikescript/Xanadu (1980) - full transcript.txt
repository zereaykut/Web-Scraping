Never thought we'd see you back here again. Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it. Yeah. You said this place made you crazy. I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry. "The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house. "The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years." Five years? He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers. Who could pay off a house in only five years? Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash. "A million dollars, man? See my manager. I'm busy, you know." Last one in, first one home. Hey, it's Sonny. It's Michelangelo Malone. Michelangelo, glad you're here. The ceiling needs painting. Uh-huh, all right, that's enough. Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands. Art world fails to suffer. News at 11:00. Cut it out. You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to. You know, we were all really pulling for you. Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away. Going out on his own. Really doing it. Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art. So what happened? It's what didn't happen. No bread. I fought it, that's for sure. Don't worry. I spend my whole life painting what other people want. I paint his van. I paint somebody else's mural. I paint Simpson's album covers. Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do. Well, you can try it again. You will, won't you? Look who decided to drop in. Where's your white flag? You have a way with words, Simpson. You know that? Same old wise-ass attitude. I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back. We did. But I have one question. Why the hell did you take me back? Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around. But this time no more artsy-craftsy Sonny Malone touches, huh? Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you. Am I coming in loud and clear? Yeah. Good. Here. You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started. That's great, isn't it? Picasso only gets to be called a genius. I get to be called the fastest painter around. Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend. You interested? Not right now. Hey. Mmm, she's great looking. I think that's this crazy girl I just ran into. Yeah? I was walking through the park. She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me. Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version. What did you do? Nothing. She took off. She took off? Come on! Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy? I'm gonna go find out who she is. You mean right now? Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why? - Because you're nuts! - Simpson's gonna kill him. Listen, Sonny, I told you. I don't know who she is. She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check. And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist. What do you mean, she doesn't exist? I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album. Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't! Down here at me. Now look to your right. Yeah, that's good. Listen, Sonny, I don't know who she is. How can you not know who she is? You took the picture. Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover. I snapped maybe 100 shots. In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame. The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets. I liked it, so I used it. That's the whole story. She just appeared? No, no, appeared then disappeared. Now, don't you go spreading this around. This is one of my best covers. Why do you want to know who she is, anyway? I like her. Hey, Lou. You seen her around here? No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right? Let me show you my daughters. That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning. Come on, get your balloons. Seventy-five cents. - I'll meet you later. - All right. Come on, come on over here. Hi. Hi. I'll take one, please. There you go. See you. All right, come on now. Hey, mister. What are you doing up there? Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid. A little lunchtime serenade? I don't mind. It's kind of nice. But I was just wondering where they laid out the body. I mean, you got something a little more upbeat? Sure. Better? At least it's faster. Here, give me a hand, kid. Sure. Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to. Want some popcorn? Yeah, thanks. You work around here, kid? Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records. You in the music business? What are you? Are you a record producer? A sound engineer? No. I'm sort of a painter. You, you paint at a record business? Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers. But why? I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores. Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh? Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours. You got it. You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired. It's a refined name for "bum." I don't believe it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Hey, kid. Hey, wait up! Where are you going? Hey, you! Come on! Hold on! Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this. I'll bring it back. Sure. If you bring it back in person. You got it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Where are you going? Get that bike off the pier! Oh, shit! Whoo! You're a real Errol Flynn, kid. What other stunts do you do? Man, this whole thing is screwing me up. What whole thing? Ah, nothing. Come on, have a cup of coffee. Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger. Go on. What's on your mind? Okay. I run into this girl this morning. Never saw her before in my life. She kisses me and disappears. So what's so weird about that? What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint. I mean, that's crazy, right? Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her? No. Then why ask? So I'll keep looking for her. Okay, kid, but take a tip from me. What's that? Don't look underwater anymore. Thanks a lot. Hey, Al, where you going? Hey, Sonny. It's good to see you, man. How you doing, Big Al? How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van? Hey, and the chicks love it. Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work. It's beautiful, man. Where you headed? East. Where you going? West. Hang on. I'll give you a ride. No, that's cool. Forget it. I owe you one. All right. Okay, hit it. Relax and enjoy it, man. We're taking the scenic route. Yeah, just don't forget I'm back here. Hey, that's the place on the album cover! Slow down, I wanna get off here. Here? Thanks for the ride.

Now I've seen you three times in one day. That's a little too coincidental. Sounds like you don't believe it. Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth, I don't believe it. You're right. It's too coincidental. Someone must be setting us up. What do you mean? Hey, wait a minute! I didn't have anything to do with this! Really? Yeah, really, I didn't. Hey! Who said I was talking about you? You come here often? Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me. You must live around here then. Sometimes. Say, you think we could… See each other again? Yeah. Would you like that? Why? I don't know. I don't have a very good reason. I'd just like to see you again. Where are you? I don't know where I'm supposed to look. ♪ Bring all your dreams alive ♪ ♪ For you ♪ We'll see each other again. Bye, Sonny. How'd you know my name? Hey, wait a minute! I don't know your name. Kira. Kira. I was in big trouble. So what did you do about it? Nothing. Hi, Sonny. What are you doing here? It's early. Yeah, it's really early. I'm working. Well, that's wonderful. Oh, hello there. Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny? Oh, yeah. He works here. Always comes in late, though. Say, that's pretty damn good. It is. It's too good. That's what's wrong with it. It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you. Is that too difficult? If you want me to work, I'll work. If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too. Don't be a wise ass, Malone. That painting should be done. What are you wasting all this time on the girl for? Because that's how she really looks. I don't give a damn how she really looks. Just get it finished. Now, when are you gonna have it done? Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done. But that's only an approximate guess. Five minutes, my office. If it's six, keep walking. Sonny, what did you do? Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it. It goes with the job. Four minutes. What difference does it make? I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday. So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday. What does it cost? Oh, nothing. Maybe just the truth. Just go in there and agree with him. That's all he wants. You want me to say that Tuesday's Wednesday, right? Everyday of the week. Three and a half minutes. All right! I'll be right back. Sit down. You think you're pretty special around here, don't you? No. I never said I was special. Well, you're not. I mean, you didn't discover art, you know. Who do you think did that? I did. Surprises you, doesn't it? No, not really. Now, I've got an office, I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call. That's because I smartened up and I gave up art. I think you made the right decision. I want you to smarten up, too. Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them. But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there. That's art. Just paint what you're told to paint. If you start making changes, then other people start making changes. And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do. That's not a company. That's chaos. Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers. Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace. Tuesday's Wednesday. Hey, clarinet. How you doing? Hey, what do you say, kid. What're you doing up there? Trying to get down. Grab a hold of the ladder. Sure. Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves. Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. Malone and McGuire. Sounds like a vaudeville team. What you got there? Oh, this is a real gem. I've been waiting months for it. Ah, Glenn Miller. You wouldn't know about him. He was before your time. So was Beethoven, but I know who he is. Do you like Glenn Miller? Do you like rock and roll? I love rock and roll. I love Glenn Miller. This place is incredible. It belonged to a silent movie star. Obviously, they did things big in those days. What do you do with all this space? Nothing really. But I love this room because it makes my records sound great. Well, I've only got one thing to say. Remember, I gave you some popcorn. Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller. So, all set up. There he goes. Nothing like that sound, huh? That sound was a miracle. Hey, Danny, that's you. Yeah. Hey, this girl… Danny, there's this girl… Listen. That's me. Hey, that's all right. You got any more surprises? This is what I call my memorabilia room. Sort of the story of Danny McGuire. Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman. You really knew those guys? Yeah. We used to all hang out together. After I toured with Miller, I got my own band and my own club on West 51 st Street. It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by. Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two. Well, now it's a parking lot. Why did you give it up? Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction. It was a girl. The girl on the album. Yeah. The singer with the band. When she left, I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right? Boy, did I teach her a lesson. Never saw her again. After that, the heart went out of my music. I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable. Three cheers for comfort. You ever think about going back into music? No. Only about 20 or 30 times a day. So, you gonna do it? Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days. But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again. Why don't you? I've had real estate agents looking for two years. They can't find the right place. Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy. No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love. You gotta feel a special attachment, a special… Like you and your friend… Kira. Kira. Hey, why don't you help me look? Maybe you can come up with something. Me? Sure. You've got a good eye. Stranger things have happened. Yeah, I guess they have. Listen, I gotta go. I understand. I'll let myself out? Sure. So long. See you around.

Hey! Oh, I'm sorry. You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I tried to be quiet. How long you been standing there? Just a few seconds. Should I go? Oh, no, stay. You paint beautifully. This is the first time I've cared about what I've painted in a long time. That's a shame. It must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really matter to you. Yeah. I met a guy the other day. He told me I should take long lunch hours. A guy? Yeah. Someone I met at the beach. He's got this crazy idea he wants to build a club, and he asked me if I'd help him find a place. All the real estate agents in this town, he asks me, right. That's not such a crazy idea. You've got a good eye. That's what he said. If it's a place you want, what about this one? My place, where we met. That? Forget it. I think it has a very special aura about it. It's a dump! You're supposed to be an artist. Use your imagination. Thanks a lot, I'm all out. You know, I really think you believe that. I've had enough for tonight. Come on, let's get out of here. Okay. What's this? Shh, we gotta be quiet. I thought we were going skating. I wanna show you the special studio first. Only the biggest groups get to record here. It's really kind of magic. Mmm? Yeah. They flash all sorts of pictures on screens. Really? Can we see it? Straight ahead. But pictures in a recording studio? Why? For inspiration. Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect. I've only watched them do this a couple of times before. Let's see… Turn on that one. And this. I don't know how to make the whole thing work. Do everything. Go on. Press them all. I don't wanna break it. Then press them carefully! What the hell. I didn't like the job anyway. Let's see… Now will we see the magic? Sure. Come on.

Our first dance together. Followed by our first being-kicked-out together. Now I want to go somewhere else. Where? Find out more about you. You know enough about me. I wanna know about you. I'm serious. So am I. Well, after all that, do you think you'd let your imagination roam a little? Look, I won't even start in on that one. What are you doing? - What do you think you're doing? - Oh, nothing. Oh. Well, well, well. Now, what a coincidence. Look where we just happened to end up. You think you're real clever, don't you? Well, I just didn't want you to close your eyes to any possibilities. You really think this could work out for Danny? I think this place could be anything you want it to be. See, it's simple. Your friend has a dream, and you want to be involved in something you really believe in. Well, maybe his dream is big enough for the both of you. So here we are. Someone who believes that dreams come easy, and… Someone who doesn't know what they believe in. So just think about it, okay? Just think about it. You gotta be kidding. This place? They used to have wrestling here. So it's got a history of success. It needs some fixing up. I think it could look terrific. So could the Titanic. Kid, you don't need a builder. You need a demolition team. Look, I know it's a wreck now, but I can see it coming to life again. Just check it out, Danny. That's all I'm asking. Well, what put you onto this? A girl. Oh, that explains everything. Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a certain kind of aura about this place? Well, if that's what you call it, it's got it all right. Let's see the rest of it. Of course, it's not small and intimate like my club in New York. But then again, that was back in 1945 and things are bigger now. And this place… Whoo. Sure is big. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't know. Naturally, I can't take all this too seriously. But if I were going to do something about it, and I can't say I am because, you see, I'm a builder, and a builder has to take his time deciding these things. But if I were going to do something about it, just speaking hypothetically, it just might work. You think so? Might. If I planned it right. Let's see… Stage over there. Stairs there and there and back there. Kid, can you imagine it? Imagine what? A bandstand right over there in that corner. And a big band, like in the '40s. No, no, no. Bandstands went out with running boards. Over there… A great rock and roll band. This is the '80s. Real smooth dancers. Wild trombone. The band decked out in tuxedos. Six guys wearing electric orange. Synthesizer, heavy percussion, electric guitar. Lots of glamor. Everybody dressed in elegance and style. Do it, Daddy, do it. Yeah, man.

I can't take that. Why? I don't know the first thing about being a partner. Well, it's easy. We share the responsibilities and we argue a lot. It's like being married, without the good part. Come on, kid. Is it a deal? Okay. It's a deal. What do you know! I'm back in show business. Now, I can't wait. I gotta look over every inch of this place. I only wish we could see better. I got a flashlight in the car. Will you get it? Yeah. It's our first collaboration as partners. And, oh, partner? Partner, what'll we name the place? Yeah. What the hell to call it? "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree…" "Where Alph, the sacred river, ran "Through caverns measureless to man "Down to a sunless sea." "Down to a sunless sea." Yes, Xanadu. I'm Kira. Of course. You're Kira. But… But? I mean… Don't I know you? I don't think so. Are you sure because… Because? Well, I mean… I don't know. I was thinking that I… Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it. So, you're gonna do it? Yes, we're gonna do it. Total insanity. Only if you think so. Well, even if it is, it's worth a try. Xanadu. How do you think that'll look on a marquee? - Hmm, wonderful. - Hey! When did you get here? Just a minute ago. What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute she's here, the next minute, who knows? Guess what you own half of, partner. What? Xanadu. Xanadu. Xanadu. Hi, guys. Hey, Picasso. Hey. How you doing? Let's see, what's first on the agenda? - Hey, who are you calling? - Leave a dime on the counter. Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone. I wanna see you right away. Hey, what's going on here? Who cares what's going on. Just get out before he gets here. Yeah. I'll fix everything up. I'll tell him it was a joke. Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay. Are you loaded? Because, when you sober up, you're gonna be real sorry. He should be coming in just about now. Malone, what the hell is going on? Simpson, I've worked like a dog trying to make Tuesday Wednesday. I couldn't do it. I must be a failure. Is he straight? You told me if I didn't do things the right way, I'd be fired. Well, you were right. Huh? I'm fired! Malone, I want you out of here in five minutes. That's five minutes, Malone, and if it's six, just keep walking. Got it? I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it! You know that dream of mine to get out of here? Well, it's happening, and you're all invited. Opening night, whatever you want, it's on the house. You know, I always wanted to say that line. Shit. Okay. To Xanadu. To dreams. I couldn't have done it without you. How is it? Heavenly. You're the one that's heavenly. No, don't. What's the matter? Did I do something? No. You know, I don't know anything about you. Where you live, where you were born. There's nothing to know. Where do you live? With my sisters. Where? In an apartment. Yeah, but where's the apartment? On the second floor. Look, I don't even know how to find you. Yeah, but you always do. Okay. That's a dead end. What's your last name? Same as my father's and mother's. Yeah, but what is it? What? My father's or my mother's? I don't care. Either one. Same as mine. Okay, I get it. No questions. No questions, no lies. No questions, no truth either. Listen, you know enough about me already. Any more, you're gonna get a headache. Are you living with somebody? Yes. I'm living with my sisters. I told you already.

Only the best. To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. And Glenn Miller. Hello. How's it all going? So far so good. Kira, I want you to promise me one thing. Anything.

You need some… Glitz. "Glitz"? Something sharp looking. You know, something with a bit of pizzazz to it. - Hot. - Oh. Well, if I need some… Glitz. …glitz, then I gotta go get some. Where do you go to get it? At a franchised glitz dealer. At a franchised glitz dealer.

Okay, we'll see you tomorrow. So long. I wonder what would have happened if I got that album to paint? Don't worry. Your turn will come. Everyone gets at least one chance at feeling like that. Yeah. That's what they say. That's what I say. All right, what's next, boss? Well, we're down to little details. Fountains, yes. The mirrors, yes. Next, we need those new parking signs. Oh, the signs are here. We just haven't put them up yet. Well, come on. Give me a hand. Let's get them up. I'll be right back. I wanna talk to you about the sound system. Sure. You've made the place look beautiful. Just did What the kid said. Oh, I see a little Danny McGuire here and there. Oh, just here and there. Don't tell anybody, but I'm nervous. What about? Well, I haven't had an opening night since 1945. Wow! I guess I got the jitters. Well, just pretend we're back in 1945 all over again. I don't have to pretend. It is 1945 all over again. Well, that takes care of that. Sonny, don't worry about that sound system. I looked over it twice today and it's fine. You kids go on home. Bye, Danny. 1945. You did it. Tomorrow's your big day. It's all gonna come true. Tomorrow's gonna be the most beautiful day in the world. Kira. I love you. I love you, Sonny. What's the matter? All of it, everything. We can't go on pretending this is for real. I know, it is hard to believe. I can't have these kind of feelings. It's beginning to hurt. This part of it was never supposed to happen. I don't understand. What do you mean, "hurt"? I know I shouldn't, but I do, and it's crazy. Sonny, there's something I have to tell you about myself. I know all I need to know. No, I have to tell you. I have no choice. All I was sent to do was to make Xanadu happen. I don't get it. Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to hurt you. That was the last thing I wanted to happen. I'm not as I appear to you. Have you ever heard the expression, "Kissed by a muse"? That's what I am. I'm a muse. I'm glad somebody's having a good time. Please don't make a joke. I'm serious. I come from Mount Helicon. I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters. My real name is… Are you telling me that's not real? I'm trying to tell you the truth. Why don't you believe me? Look up the word "muse" in the dictionary. Go on. Page 728. Read it. Okay. All right, I'll read it. "Muse. Any of the nine sister…" Like the album cover? Hmm. "Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek mythology "presiding over song and poetry and the arts and sciences. "And do you believe me now, Sonny?" How'd you do that? What's going on? The television. Well, well, look who's here. Who's chasing you this time, Vargas? The cops? Or the mob? Don't get smart with me, Nick. I told you to stay away from Brenda Trent. Yes, you did tell me. What should I do, Sonny? Dive at him or make a martini? - What'? - Who you talking to? Sonny Malone. He doesn't believe Kira's a muse. How can you be talking to me? You're a movie. I ain't got time for this, Malone. Brenda's the only one that saw me at the racetrack. Now if the lady says she's a muse, she's a muse. Who's that? Brenda! Kira. Sonny. I think he needs a drink. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks. Good luck on the opening of your joint, kid. Wish I could be there. Oh, wow! Oh, Sonny. We've been painted by Michelangelo. Shakespeare's written sonnets about us. Beethoven's played music for us. We're not supposed to feel emotion or show any feelings. Muses are just supposed to inspire. I fell in love. You did? Well, what do you think happened to me? It was a mistake. I broke the rules. Well, now what the hell do we do, huh? Answer that, muse! I don't know. I'm sorry. It just never should have happened. Well, it did. I love you, Sonny. Kira. I'll love you forever. I Will. I'll love you forever. Kira! Wait! I'll love you forever. Hey, painter! I've been looking for you. Where you been? Here. Well, how do I look? Aren't you gonna say anything about my new threads? Hubba, hubba. Well, we're gonna miss you tonight. It won't be any fun without you. I told you. I can't go. Xanadu doesn't matter anymore. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? How can it not matter? This was our dream. Well, wasn't it? There's no Xanadu 'cause there's no Kira. She made it real. So find her! Bring her back! Dreams die. No. No, no, no. Not by themselves. We kill them. Now, if you give up, you'll be sitting on that rock 30 years from now, just like I was. I know how you feel, kid. I felt the same way once. I did. I didn't know how important love is. But let me tell you something. Somehow, somewhere, there's a way to get her! If she got here, there's a way to get there. Believe me, kid, it's up to you.

Sonny. How did you get here? You didn't think I'd let you get away from me, did you? You'll have to go back. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. I can't go with you, but you have to get out before it's too late. Too late for what? Oh, please, you took a big chance coming here. What's going on here? I'm taking you back with me, Kira. It can't be done. Nobody's ever taken anyone out of here. Not in the whole history of… The whole history. I'll make them let you go. Hey, Zeus! Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God. I wanna talk to you. We don't use those old-fashioned names anymore. In any case, it's me you want to speak to. I've come to get Kira. She's not leaving! It's impossible! That's what you think. That's what you think. How'd you know I was gonna say that? Put it this way. I'm a good guesser. What else do you know? Everything. All right, then. You know this. I'm sticking to this place till hell freezes over. Sonny! You'll leave now and you'll leave without Kira! Why? Because other people have dreams. So send another muse. You got muses running around all over the place. One dream, one muse. Wait… Wait a minute. Just listen to me, okay? Kira and I love each other. Now I don't know how often that happens in this kind of place, but back on Earth, it's pretty rare. We need to be together. All right, that's enough. You're leaving. Kira's staying. No more discussions. Those are the rules and that's all there is to it. On the other hand, dear, rules were made to be broken. We'll talk about that later. Which is later and which is earlier? - I keep forgetting. - Just a minute! Isn't anyone interested in my feelings? What do you mean, "feelings"? Oh, you remember, pet. We learnt about feelings in our mortal history class. Yes, feelings. I guess that's what you call them. I've never really had them before. I've never felt this way about anyone before. And I've never asked to leave here. Not ever. Not once in the whole time I've been here. No, it's true, dear, she hasn't. Not in all these centuries. Or is it minutes? I do keep mixing them up. Please, can't we just have this one night? Just one night? No, no, it's just not possible. Goodbye, Sonny Malone. Hey, Kira? Just one moment? Goodbye, Sonny.
