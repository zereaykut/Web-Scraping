foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- (GASPING) (PANTING) (RUSTLING) Ahhh! Ahhh! MAN ON TABLET: Mate, mate, mate... Hang on, hang on, hang on. Okay. That's a fucking panther. (RUSTLING) (CHUCKLING) That, that is going on YouTube. MATT: Well, it's definitely not four otters synchronized swimming this time. Very funny. I was kind of hoping we could go on a normal vacation this year, you know, sun, beach lounger, no waiting around for an amphibious sea monster -named Nessie to pop up for air. -(LAUGHING) It's gonna be different this time, southwest England is in the middle of a huge cat flap. (SCOFFS) There's been over 20 livestock attacks around Xmoor in the last two months and nobody's managed to get a decent shot of the cat. And... I haven't showed you the best bit. MATT: 25,000? GEORGIA: That's almost 40,000 US. Just think of the places we could go and shoot on that money. There's no way they'd be offering that kind of money if they really think something's out there. Well, the sheep aren't killing themselves. Remember what we agreed before about expectations? Not to have any? I just don't want to see you get disappointed again. Or eaten by a panther, don't know what'd be worse. (LAUGHING) Remind me why I'm with you. I carry the equipment. Whoa! Was your boss cool with you taking all this? Yeah. As long as we get it back before he notices it's gone. You didn't tell him? Well, he never asked. Seriously, Matt. I can't believe you did this for me. Thank you. It's okay. -But I'll drive. -Oh, hey, wait a... Oh. MATT: I can't even deal with an eight pound domestic cat. How we gonna catch up with a 200 pound wild son of a bitch that belongs in the zoo? You worry about cameras, animal tracker finds the cats. Oh, yeah. The fantastic Mr. Fox. The idea there's a second dude crazy enough to go monster hunting with you is a fucking trip. He's retarded, right? I gotta meet this guy. Whoa! GEORGIA: Okay. Is there another way we can go? No, this is the only road. They're definitely fucking with us. -Maybe they're sick. -In the head? -They might need help. -I don't think so. What are you... Oh, man! (SIGHING) Hello? I don't think that's their car. Hey, are you guys okay? MATT: What the fuck? -Oh, shit! -Oh, my God. -Oh, shit! -(MEN LAUGHING) Fuck! Move, come on! Run! Go. Go, go, go! -GEORGIA: Seat belts on! -Come on! MATT: Can you make it go any faster? Oh, you hired this piece of shit! (PANTING) After these assholes, a giant man-eating cat... Oh, shit! I guess there's more to England than Supernanny and Prince Harry. MATT: I'm beginning to doubt this farmhouse will have HBO. GEORGIA: Mmm. MATT: Running water? Hello? Fox? (DOOR CREAKING) MATT: It's open. If he didn't answer, it means he's probably gone. Gone where? Milk a horse for breakfast? How the fuck would I know? (CLANGING) -(SQUAWKING) -(GEORGIA YELPS) It's just a bird. Fox? Are you in here? It's me, Georgia. MATT: Nice. (INSECT BUZZING) Was this dude a fucking junkie? Ahh! Get out! Go! Get out of here! -Okay. -Come on. Great start, he's probably been murdered by crackheads. Or sacrificed like the Wicker Man. Get out of here. Or not. (FLIES BUZZING) Why would anyone want to set fire to sheep? GEORGIA: Let's ask him. Hey. Hey. All right already. (CHUCKLING) Who's this? Uh, Matt, this is Conrad Fox. Fox, this is Matt. I thought you were coming alone. (LAUGHING) I told you about my boyfriend. Matt. Remember? Right, yeah. Nice to meet you, man. I heard a lot about you. Welcome to Xmoor. So what happened to these sheep? They were left behind, became easy prey. You mean a cat killed them? Those that didn't starve. (COUGHING) You all right? So, the people who lived here before, did they see the cat? They were too concerned with keeping the wolf from the door. Well, they better not come back here 'cause there's a crazy drug addict living in their house. -(CHUCKLES) -Have you seen her? I brought her. GEORGIA: Can you tell us your name? Just ask her about the beast. Can you describe what happened? KARA: It were last month. I was lost. The mist had come down and I couldn't see where I was going. I heard a noise behind me and... All of a sudden, the beast come out of nowhere and knocked me over. I didn't know what hit me. He held me down and tried to bite my throat out. How can you be sure it was a male? Males are more aggressive. Were you badly hurt? Did you think it was gonna kill you? Yeah. If I hadn't of got away, I'd be lying dead on that moor right now. We should have never come back here. How did you get away from the beast? I ran until my feet bled. Those scars on your arms, are they from the beast? I don't want to do this no more. (SOBBING) She's still very traumatized. (DOOR CLOSING) -It's what we agreed. -That's it? It's all I've got and it's what we agreed, okay? Yeah, but you never said you were gonna film me, did you? (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Is the mic on that camera picking anything up? No, too far away. Well, she's more than just camera shy. She's a fucking meth head. What were you saying about this dude again? -Do you want a repeat of the Sasquatch trip? -Mmm-mmm. Fox is an animal tracker, we don't have a hope in hell of finding any big cats without him. Okay and what is Doctor Dolittle using for guidance? Hmm, is that directions scribbled out by a crack whore? (LAUGHING) Why, yes it is. What exactly does this dude know about animals? He's got over 20 years' experience tracking big cats in Peru, Buton, and South Africa. Where do you think he dug up Skeletor? Come on, Matt, not everyone is as lucky as we are. I'm sure he could afford a couple of items off the dollar menu for his girlfriend. She's not his girlfriend. -How do you... -(CELL PHONE RINGING) -Oh, shit, it's my boss. -Don't answer it. No, no, no, no. I got to. It's like 3:00 a.m. there. He must be calling about the cameras. Mr. Saperstein, good morning. How are you? (INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER THE PHONE) Not good. Okay, uh, what? You're rambling. (STAMMERS) Slow down. (SCREAMING) GEORGIA: Don't touch me! Get off right now! Get off! (SCREAMING) MAN 1: Keep your mouth shut! There must have been some mistake. I'm sure I can... Did you hear that? MAN 1: Hold her down. Hold her down. MAN 2: I am. -Don't touch me! Ahh! -MAN 1: Pull her trousers down. GEORGIA: Matt! Matt! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) If I could just explain... (MAN SCREAMING) FOX: Get out of the fucking van! (MAN SCREAMING) Matt! Matt! Georgia, over here. Over here. (GRUNTING) -Fucking down, stay down! -Fox, what the fuck? MAN: Please. MATT: Fox! MAN: We didn't know, I swear. I swear. Fuck off! It's all right. It's all right. (GASPING) (CREAKING) GEORGIA: It was those kids who burned out the car. And they were going through our stuff and when they saw me, they... (VOICE QUIVERS) They grabbed me. MATT: He was gonna kill that kid, wasn't he? Did you see the size of that gun? He was only trying to protect me. He isn't a threat. MATT: I hope you're right. We should get going. -Hey, you don't have to... -It's getting late. (ENGINE STARTING) (GASPS) You promised you'd take me back! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) MATT: What the... Dude... GEORGIA: Fox! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! GEORGIA: Shouldn't we at least offer to give her a ride? There isn't time. We've got a lot of ground to cover in the light. Well, what if those guys come back and she's here all alone? (LAUGHING) They wouldn't dare. Seriously, Fox, this isn't right. (SIGHS) She has money for a taxi, she's got a phone. -But she's... -In need of a couple of days detox. Dude, that's cold. Well, believe me, she's better off there than back on the moor. MATT: How big is the moor? FOX: 267 square miles. GEORGIA: That's big. FOX: Same size as Singapore. The biggest hunt was Operation Beastie in '83. The army sent 40 soldiers out for a fortnight. They saw a cat, but couldn't get a clean shot on it. MATT: Oh, and if the military can't find him, what chance do we have? That's what they said when I hunted down the blue tiger. You know, Fox, I think it'd make a better documentary if we didn't kill the cat. Then you should have hired David Bellamy. I'm a hunter. (SOFTLY) Who the fuck is David Bellamy? How the fuck should I know? (PANTING) Should I start getting these set up? Not yet, wait until he gets the scent. This way. I'm beginning to get the scent... Of bullshit. Meow! Matt, get out of the way. GEORGIA: How long do you think it'll be before we see evidence of the panther? Um, there's no such thing as a panther. -But you said that... -Escaped cats were melanistic leopards. The theory is that they interbred with other species of anomalous cats -over the years to create breeds like the pumapard. -(MATT LAUGHS) What are you doing? Are you drinking already? Nope. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Hey, can I get some help? (GRUNTING) MATT: What the hell's a pumapard? GEORGIA: (CHUCKLES) It's a half-puma, half-leopard crossbreed. MATT: Next we'll be looking for ligers. GEORGIA: He knows what he's doing. MATT: Really? 'Cause we've been walking all day and I'm beginning to think that Captain Ahab couldn't find a kid in a ball of string. Shouldn't we be heading back to civilization before it gets too dark? Aw! Why do we need to find the cat when we already have the biggest pussy in England right here? This is it. What? Slew Wood. The lair of the beast. Okay, let's get these up quick, we don't want to miss the beast's evening meal. Oh, a covert camera. Transmits a signal to the hard drive in my bag, recording an individual stream of each camera. Kind of technical. You wouldn't understand. So this is what you bring to the party. How many you got? -Forty-two. -Huh. Better get a move on, then, hadn't you? (MOCKING) Better get a move on, then, hadn't you? (SIGHS) (BIRD FLUTTERING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (GROWLING) God, you're such a dork. This place is foul. Hope we're not standing in the middle of some giant kitty litter tray. -Ugh. -You know, it smells more like... -Death? -(TWIGS SNAPPING) (GASPS) Fox? No. How long do you think it'll take for you to set up the viewing station? (BOTH MUMBLING) Ooh! God. -Are you okay? -(PANTING) Yeah. Phew. -Oh, shit. -What? Can you just stop it? You're freaking me out. What? I don't see any... (SCREAMING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) -Was that a leg? -I think it was. -It was a fucking leg! -(SCREAMING) (GASPING) I heard screaming. There's a body. -Where? -Over there on the ground. Show me. (MATT DRY HEAVING) Oh, Jesus Christ. (RETCHING AND COUGHING) Oh! Oh, the smell. Oh! (GRUNTING) (GASPING) She's been here for some time. -She? -(PANTING) Fox, you told me the cat just killed animals! The cat's not responsible for this. Unless it's learned how to tie knots. The phone won't work. There's not a mast for 20 miles. This girl has a family who must be going out of their minds! When we get out of here... -What? What is it? -Ahh! (ALL SHRIEKING) -Another one? -Yes, another fucking one! GEORGIA: Why would there be two dead bodies in the same place? Three, four... Look! Five, six! (SHRIEKS) Stop fucking counting! What is this place? It's a dumping ground. A what? He's right. Sometimes they dump all the bodies in the same remote place. (STAMMERING) Who? Guys like Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway, they return to the sites so they can... So they can what? (PANTING) Fuck the corpses. (GEORGIA SHUDDERING) Run! Where are you going? Hey! Hey, Georgia. Hey, Georgia! Wait! (TERRIFIED PANTING) Come on! Come on! (PANTING) (COUGHING) You got the compass? -It's in my bag, but... -What about the map? We want to get back to the van. -You okay? -(GASPING) Who would do that to those girls? A beast more gruesome than any cat. Well, the sooner the cops get here, the sooner we... If we tell the police now, that beast will get away. We have to tell the police. There are dead girls in there and they deserve justice. And we're the only chance they've got of getting it. (EXHALES) Listen, it's like Matthew said, when someone creates a dumping ground like that, they tend to make a habit of returning to it very regularly. Listen, Georgia, the police are bound by procedure. They're obliged to remove the bodies immediately. But if they were to leave them there and wait, there's a good chance the killer would walk into a trap. Fox, if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting... Filming the hunt and capture of a serial killer would make headline news all over the world. Wait in the forest to catch a serial killer is the single most suicidal idea I have ever heard in my entire fucking life! We don't need to do this! Haven't you even heard of DNA? The cameras are rigged, my gun's loaded. One night is all I'm asking. Then at dawn, whatever happens, we go and report what we found. Seriously, where did you find this maniac? We'd be heroes for catching a serial killer that was right under the nose of the police while they were too fucking foolish to see it. You knew. You fucking knew. What are you talking about? This was never about finding the cat, it was all about setting him up as the hero of the ultimate hunt, the most dangerous game of all, isn't that right, Fox? Georgia, don't be ridiculous, he wouldn't lie about... How did you know? Tell me how you knew. Tell me! My fiance Camille was murdered in South Africa two years ago. I was lost, I ran out of money, I had to come back home to Exeter. I hadn't lived here for 20 years. Everyone I knew had long since gone. I went on the Internet and I met a girl called Allison. She was a prostitute. All right, stop there. We're not judging you for what you've done. We just want to get out of here. I'm not a killer. She was my friend. She helped me to open up. I finally began to feel like I hadn't died, with Camille. Anyway, one day she wasn't there anymore, she wasn't anywhere. And she wasn't the only one, several girls had disappeared, and no one seemed to care. That's when I met Kara. Who's Kara? FOX: The girl we left at the farm. I knew that bitch had never seen a cat! The beast drugged her and brought her here to those woods. She managed to claw her way free and escape across the moor. (PANTING) GEORGIA: Why didn't she tell the police? FOX: She did. They came out here, had a look, but obviously not hard enough. I suspected something but believe me, I never imagined anything like what we found in there. Let's get out of here. And regret it for the rest of your life? Well, should we stay out here, it may only be another couple of hours. GEORGIA: You shouldn't have lied to me, Fox. I know. GEORGIA: Just wait for a second. MATT: Come on, just fucking walk! GEORGIA: Slow down, just take a second. MATT: We need to keep going. We gotta keep moving. GEORGIA: Slow down. Can't you calm down? Ah, my fucking ankle! (GROANS PAINFULLY) Fuck! GEORGIA: Can you walk? (MATT GROANS) We can't slow down. GEORGIA: Maybe if we just take a second. We need to keep going. Ahh! Jesus. We don't even know which way to go. (PANTING) Just stick with me, I'm gonna get you off of this moor. (GEORGIA YELPS) -Matt? Matt! -(GASPING) Come on, come on. Here you go. Matt! MATT: Help! GEORGIA: You've got to grab my hand. Grab hold of the stick. Grab hold of the stick! Right. Hold on. One, two, three, pull! One, two, three, pull! (GROANING) (ALL GASPING) (COUGHING) GEORGIA: You okay? Fuck this place! (ANIMAL YELPS) (SHIVERING) (EXHALES) Listen, I was born here and I wouldn't risk crossing the moor at night. Can you make it back to van on that... It's a day away, two perhaps with a sprained ankle. What if we both help him? We need to get him proper bandages and dry clothes from his bag or he'll die of hypothermia. I followed you two for about a mile and you didn't notice. I might not have been the only one. (SHIVERING) So, we go back to the forest, and what then? We get you changed, then we wait. And what if the beast shows? You film me apprehending him and we take him to the law. This isn't The Cat of the Baskervilles! He's one overconfident, unarmed loner, who won't be expecting an armed hunter or our eyes in the trees. Bullshit, we can't do this. Matt! The girl I met in the Red Line that night spoke until dawn about how she wanted her films to be noticed. I've spent my entire life hunting innocent animals, you spent yours trying to film figments of people's imaginations. Now we've got a chance to do something real. Something that matters! And you want to run away! The only thing that matters to me right now is staying alive. You really think you can protect her? With my life. You can't be serious right now. We need the cops and we need them now! I can't protect you, I couldn't before at the house and I can't do shit now. Don't say that. We're gonna tighten this up, we're gonna grab you over our shoulders and we're gonna make it back. I don't think we can make it across the moor alone. Our best chance to stay alive today is with Fox. So promise me when this is over, you'll stay away from that motherfucker. The hunt is on. (WHIMPERING) There's your stuff. (COUGHING) (GAGS) (GUN COCKING) We need to be able to see through all your cameras immediately. -It'll take at least an hour. -I need it faster. -But I can't possibly... -Get to it. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... (GROANS MOURNFULLY) Fuck. (FOX GROANING) Oh, shit. I told you to set up. (PANTING) I forgot the bandages. (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GASPS) (BIRD FLUTTERING) -(GASPING) -It's okay, it's me. What took you so long anyway? -Just get the first aid. -Okay! Hurry the fuck up! -What is your problem! -Get the fucking bandage. Would you calm down? I can fucking do it myself. Matt! (MOANS PAINFULLY) -You okay? -Ah, yeah. (PANTING) -(GROANING) -Are you okay? Okay. Let's go, let's go. -What? What do you mean? -Shut the fuck up and let's go. Let go, you're hurting me. -Let's go right now. -But you said the moors are too dangerous. -(PAINFUL GROAN) -What's gotten into you? -It's Fox. -FOX: I'm what? Where are you going in such a hurry? -(FOX CRYING OUT IN PAIN) -What are you doing? Come on lets go, he's the beast! What? How do you know? (FOX BELLOWING) Fox, get off him! Not until he's had some discipline. Fox get off of him! You're gonna kill him! (GROANS LOUDLY) Are you okay? I told you. What are you doing? Run! (PANTING) No one's going anywhere. He killed those girls and he brought us back here to find his handiwork! I saw him jacking off on the bodies. Jesus, son, I wasn't there for God's sake! Look, I've never hunted a man before. I went back in there to steel myself, so that when the time comes, I wouldn't hesitate. Georgia, how can you trust him? He went in with a goddamn bar! He brought you out 'cause he's planning to kill you, too! Fox? If you're convinced there's no killer out there, take my H&K. Go on, take it. It's not a trick. Put it down, put it down. Put that down! Just so long as you know, that if you're wrong and he appears, it will be up to you to defend us. -Give it back now. -We can't trust him. -Give him back the gun! -No fucking way! You don't know how to use it. It's not like pointing and shooting a camera, Matthew. No second takes, no re-shoots. Hmm? You ready to pull the trigger to stop him getting away? (PANTING) If it comes to that. Without killing him... 'Cause you'd go to fucking jail. I will do whatever it takes to protect her. So be it. (GULPING) I need some more. What? This isn't a fucking booze cruise. It's that stench. I need to burn it out of my mouth. Don't give her anymore. (GAGGING) You never really believed there were any cats out here, did you, Fox? They're out here, they just keep their distance. Wouldn't the dead bodies attract the... MATT: It's bullshit! They don't exist. None of the cryptids do. The way I see it, human beings have got so comfortable in their surroundings, their minds start conjuring up these imaginary predators just so they don't die of boredom. FOX: Little do they know their new natural predator drives a Land Rover. GEORGIA: There's good chance he won't come tonight, isn't there? Well, the nearly full moon will give him enough light to see what he's doing. But Matthew's little tantrum probably scared him off and he's halfway to Borneo by now. Or maybe he's been here the whole time. Think very carefully, Matthew. Ugh! It's so disgusting. -Georgia. -(SOBS) For God's sake, be quiet. I can't do this anymore! Watching these dead girls for hours and hours, smelling them rot. What they hell will people think of us? -That you ruined everything. -I don't care! -Shh. -This is sick! Nothing is worth this. You need to find a way to get us out of here right now, Fox. Georgia, calm down! I'm sorry. (EXCLAIMS IN FEAR) (STAMMERS) She's moving. Holy fucking shit! Was that... Matt! What was that? Something's alive out there. Kara was drugged. Maybe, maybe the beast drugs all his victims so that he can return to them. Oh, that poor girl. FOX: The last person she'll trust right now is a man. We have to find her and you have to call out to her. She's a young girl, for Pete's sake! Who also happens to be the only person who can identify the killer. All the more reason to find her and make sure she survives to tell. I don't think I can go back in there. Imagine what it must be like to wake up surrounded by corpses. We have to help her. GEORGIA: Wait, where are you going? The dumping ground's that way. I heard some movement from over here, call out. Do it! Hello? Call again, louder! Is anyone out there? We won't hurt you. Wait a minute, if you're so friendly with all these prostitutes, why don't you call out? Maybe they'll recognize your voice. Call again. We're going to get you some help. This is pointless. She can run as far away from here as... -Shh! -What? Sounds like...panting. Oh man, if a puma jumps out on us, I swear... -No! -(YELPS) -Oh, fuck! -Fox? Oh, my God! Get the first aid kit. -What do we... -It's in your bag at the viewing station. Wait, don't you see she attacked him? Matt, please get the fucking bandages! Fox! Fox, can you hear me? Fox! (GROANING) Wake up! Get up, there you go. (GROANS) Ah, God damn it, Matt! Don't shine it in his face. What are you doing? Matt? Matt! Shit! I'm over here. Here you go. What is it? There was a torch, over there. Get the gun, the gun! Okay. Which way did he go? -I don't know. -Oh, shit! Let off a warning shot. Okay. (GUN CLICKING) -Well, shoot it! -I just did, nothing happened. Son of a bitch gave me an unloaded gun. Georgia... Fuck him, let's just go! I am not leaving him here. -Fuck off! -Fox, can you walk? Hurry the fuck up! The killer's here, we need to go now. Where is he, where is he? Where are the bullets? Load it! Load it! Come on! Stay behind me, stay behind me. You can't be serious. He's got the gun. We're so fucking dead. (MATT SHUDDERING) MATT: We're just going in a huge circle. MAN: Choose wisely. (GUNSHOT) (VOICE IS DISTORTED) Jesus Christ, Fox, you could have hit me! Fox? (NORMAL VOICE RETURNS) We need you back with us, okay? You're scaring me. Why don't you give me the gun? Fox? -Guys. -What? The girl. (SHUDDERING) Fox, calm down. It's okay. We won't hurt you. Okay. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Okay, okay, okay. Look. Putting it down, putting it down. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Okay, okay. MATT: We don't have time for this. Taking too long. -He's right. -We need to move. You want to help her or not? Please don't be afraid. Please don't be afraid. Just grab her and go! You see something? I feel something. Huh? This... This is his labyrinth. He brings them here, to stalk them. Where are you going? Fox, come back here! Ah! (SCREAMING) Ahhh! (SHRIEKS) Matt, come on! (CRIES OUT) (PANTING) I'm a friend. I'm a... I'm a friend. Matt? Shit! (BOTH PANTING) Shh! What's your name? Vanya. I from Romania. I'm Georgia. I'm from America. Why you here? We were looking for a cat. A very big cat. (BOTH WHIMPERING) We're gonna get out of here, Vanya, okay? You and me. My boyfriend, I have to find my boyfriend. He... We don't know that. Bad man, he bring me here and hit me and leave me to dead. He kill us. Or we kill him. Come on. Come on. (SOFT GROWL-LIKE NOISE) You hear? (NOISE CONTINUES) Animal? The cat. (GUTTURAL BREATHING) Fox! (GASPS) Georgia, do it! Do it, now! Do what? He took my gun or I'd do it myself. -No, no, no. -It's the humane thing to do. Don't let me die as his prey. I'll make my intentions clear on camera. No one will think you did it maliciously. Fox, be quiet, you're gonna attract the... Attract the beast... (CRIES OUT LOUDLY) (COUGHS) (GROANING) Please be quiet. I lied. I lied to you. I brought you in danger. (WHISPERS) I told Matthew we fucked... But we didn't! I'll shout it so loud! He'll hear and he'll never trust anything... Fuck! Fuck! (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SPITTING) Move now. Move now! Wait, I know where we are. Here, you take this. And drink this, it'll help with the pain. Drink it. You watch! Why you do? We were looking for the panther. You lie! (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SCREAMING) Matt... Fuck! Fuck! Matt! Matt! Matt! Where are you? Matt, run to this! Matt! Matt! Please, Matt! (GUNSHOTS) (YELPS) (GUNSHOTS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (GROANS SOFTLY) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (SHOUTS RHYTHMICALLY) Ahhh! (PANTING) (THUNDER CRACKING) (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY) (METALLIC SQUEAKING) Hello? Is anyone there? (EXCLAIMS) Ahh! Are you a ghost? My daddy says there's ghosts in the forest. Who's your daddy... Where's your daddy now? He's gone to hunt pheasants for our tea. Do you like pheasants? Sorry. How often do you come out here? When Daddy needs to hunt. Where's your mom? I don't have one anymore. She's a ghost now. What happened to your eye? Daddy will be back soon. (WOMAN SCREAMING) It isn't real! It isn't real! (ROARING) Don't go in there! (SHUTTING DOOR) Do you want to help your daddy? You'd like that, wouldn't you? (WOMAN SCREAMING) (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SCREAMING) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (YELLS) (SCREECHING) (BIRD FLUTTERING) Vanya? Vanya. Vanya, wake up. Wake up, come on. Ahhh! (RIPPING) No! Play dead. (WHIMPERS) (SLASHING) Ahhh! You recognize the knife? Where is she? (SHOUTS) Where is she? Did you kill my boyfriend? The American guy. (GROANING) Tell me or you'll be visiting your daughter's body in that dumping ground! Wait! You don't understand, they were all alive when I left them! -Don't lie to me! -It's true! (CRYING) Do you want me to give you something to cry about, you motherfucker! Please! Don't hurt my daughter. She never done nothing to nobody. Where is Matt? I don't know! You can't finish the job, can you? You're not man enough to kill anyone, you just leave them there. -Vanya, wait! -Must kill him! (ALL CRYING OUT) (GROANING) Shit, shit! (FIRING GUN) Shit! Okay, okay, okay. No, no! Shit! (SHUDDERS) (MUFFLED BREATHING) (MAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM) (FLIES BUZZING) (WIND RUSTLING) (GRUNTS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Ahhh! MAN: Hello?
