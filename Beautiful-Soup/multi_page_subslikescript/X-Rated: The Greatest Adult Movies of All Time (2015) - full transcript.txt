AND SINCE THE EARLIEST DAYS OF CINEMA, ADULT FILMS HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE MOTION PICTURE LANDSCAPE, MAKING US GASP FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS. AS FAR BACK AS THE 1880's, FILMMAKERS SAW THE GOLDMINE POTENTIAL OF EROTIC FILM-- LOOPS, STAG FILMS, PEEP SHOW BOOTHS. FOR THE NEXT 90 YEARS, SOCIETY WATCHED SEX IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THEN IN THE 1970's, EVERYTHING CHANGED. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A MORE SOCIALLY PERMISSIVE ATMOSPHERE, DIRECTORS BEGAN TELLING STORIES SURROUNDING THE HARDCORE SEX. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, FULL-LENGTH MOVIES WITH EXPLICIT SEX WERE BEING SHOWN IN THEATERS FOR A MASS AUDIENCE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GERARD DAMIANO'S FILM, "DEEP THROAT." THIS MOVIE OPENED THE DOOR FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY ADULT FEATURE THAT CAME AFTER. WHILE THE EXAGGERATED CLOSE-UPS, CAMPY PERFORMANCES, AND FIREWORKS GOING OFF DURING ORGASMS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE COMICAL TO A MODERN AUDIENCE, IN 1972, AUDIENCES HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WHETHER DISCUSSING ADULT OR MAINSTREAM, "DEEP THROAT" REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST >> YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT MORE OUT OF SEX THAN JUST A LOT OF LITTLE TINGLES? >> YES, I WANNA HEAR BELLS AND BOMBS-- >> YES, WE JUST WENT THROUGH THAT, MISS LOVELACE. LET'S NOT DO THAT PART AGAIN. >> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDER A CERTAIN AGE UNDERSTAND JUST HOW EDGY AND HOW RADICAL IT WAS TO PUT ACTUAL SEX IN A BIG MOVIE THEATER. >> "DEEP THROAT," IN PARTICULAR, OPEN A LOT OF DOORS. IT MADE IT-- SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND THEN THAT HELPED IN MAKING >> "DEEP THROAT" AND... "THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES" PLAYED THE DOUBLE BILL FOR, >> WHEN "DEEP THROAT" CAME OUT IN NEW YORK THEATERS, LINES AROUND THE BLOCK-- JACKIE O. >> JACKIE KENNEDY WENT TO SEE-- >> DEEP THROAT IS THIS GIRL SHE'S-- SHE'S TIRED OF-- OF SEX. SHE THINKS THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE THAN JUST LITTLE TINGLES. >> IT MAKES ME FEEL SORT OF TINGLY ALL OVER, AND THEN-- >> AND THEN WHAT? >> NOTHING. I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE MORE TO SEX THAN A LOT OF LITTLE TINGLES. THERE SHOULD BE BELLS RINGING, SEAMS BURSTING, BOMBS GOING OFF-- SOMETHING. >> DO YOU WANNA GET OFF, OR DO YOU WANNA WRECK A CITY? >> SHE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE CAN'T HAVE AN ORGASM, BECAUSE SHE HAS ALL THIS SEX, AND NOTHING-- I MEAN IT'S NICE, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. SO, UM, SHE GOES TO SEE A SEX THERAPIST, MR. HARRY REIMS, WHO, UM, EXAMINES HER AND DISCOVERS THAT HER CLITORIS IS ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK OF HER THROAT. >> WELL, THERE IT IS. YOU LITTLE BUGGER! THERE IT IS! >> WHAT? >> WELL, YOUR CLITORIS, IT'S DEEP DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR THROAT. >> (SOBBING) >> NOW, NOW, MISS LOVELACE, LISTEN, HAVING A CLITORIS DEEP DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR THROAT IS BETTER THAN HAVING NO CLITORIS AT ALL. >> THERE'S A THEME SONG-- I FORGOT. UM, THERE'S A THEME SONG WHEN SHE DISCOVERS THIS-- THIS, UH, SKILL. >> ♪ DEEP THROAT ♪ ♪ DEEPER THAN DEEP YOUR THROAT ♪ ♪ DEEP THROAT ♪ ♪ ROW ROW YOUR BOAT ♪ >> SHE FINALLY HAS AN ORGASM. THERE'S A MONTAGE OF FIREWORKS AND BELLS RINGING AND A ROCKET SHIP GOING UP WHILE IT'S FLASHING BETWEEN HER FACE COMING AND... SO FUNNY. SO HE HIRES HER AS A NURSE, AND SHE GOES OUT ON CALL AND FUCKS ALL THESE GUYS. >> TELL ME, MR. MOORE, HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? >> AND, EVENTUALLY, SHE FINDS THE PERFECT PENIS FOR HER THROAT. AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER MONTAGE. IN MOST '70s PORNO, EVERYONE HAS A LOT OF HAIR, BUT IN "DEEP THROAT," LINDA IS COMPLETELY CLEAN-SHAVEN. I WONDERED IF MAYBE SHE STARTED THAT TREND PERHAPS? OR MADE IT POPULAR AT LEAST? I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE SAW IT, >> NIXON, ALONG WITH KEATING, AND THAT ADMINISTRATION WAS OUT TO STOP THE NEGATIVE PRESS OF WATERGATE AND, UH, VIETNAM. >> I THINK REVISITING THIS STORY AND REVISITING, YOU KNOW, THE TACTICS THAT CAME INTO PLAY THAT, UH, THEY HAD A PROBLEM MORALLY WITH SUBJECT MATTER, AS IN "DEEP THROAT," THE FILM, UM, IS IMPORTANT. >> AND THE EASIEST TARGET WAS THE ADULT FILM INDUSTRY. NIXON RIGGED THE COURTROOM AND RIGGED THE JUDGE AND GOT HIS, UH, CONVICTIONS AGAINST THE CAST MEMBERS OF "DEEP THROAT." >> I DEFINITELY THINK SHE'S-- SHE'S BETTER AT, UM, DEEP-THROATING THICKER COCKS THAN I AM, BUT I DEFINITELY DROOL A LOT MORE THAN SHE DOES. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS THE RAVISHMENT OF A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN ABDUCTED. >> I ANSWERED AN AD IN THE "SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE" THAT SAID "NOW CASTING FOR A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE." SO I WALKED UP THE STAIRS, AND I SAT IN THEIR OFFICE, AND HERE'S THESE TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY CHARMING, FABULOUS NOT THE LEAST BIT OF A QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THEY WERE TOTALLY HONEST GUYS. (SCREAMING) THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THE STORY OF "BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR," WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY COOL, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME OF DRUGS, SEX, AND ROCK-N-ROLL. IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING WENT. BEFORE I LEFT, I SAID, "IF YOU DO WANT ME TO DO THIS, BY THE WAY, I WANT THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THIS PERCENTAGE OF WHATEVER FOR SO MANY YEARS." AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, "DON'T CALL US, WE'LL CALL YOU." SO ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I'M SITTING AT MY HOUSE, AND THEY CALLED AND SAID, "WE WANNA DO IT." SO THEY CAME OVER FOR ME TO SIGN THE CONTRACT, AND THAT WAS, UH, THAT WAS THE END OF THAT. >> ALTHOUGH, AT FIRST, HER REACTIONS MAY LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHE IS BEING TORTURED, QUITE THE CONTRARY IS TRUE, FOR NO HARM WILL COME TO THOSE BEING RAVISHED. IN THE MORNING, SHE WILL BE SET FREE, UNAWARE OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT SHE HAS BEEN LOVED AS NEVER BEFORE. >> THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE MOVIE WAS-- AND I SAID TO THEM, "I'M AN ACTRESS, AND I SAY NOT ONE WORD." HE SAID, "OH, NO, THAT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT," WHICH IT IS. BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO CONVEY YOUR FEELINGS, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, THROUGH YOUR EYES AND YOUR ACTIONS. AND I SAID, "I DON'T REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE WILD AND SEXY, AND IT'S GONNA BE SCARY, PROBABLY, FOR ME AT CERTAIN TIMES, BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW." JOHNNIE KEYES, HE WAS THE BLACK GUY WITH THE SHARK TEETH AROUND HIS NECK AND, UM, VERY ETHNIC LOOKING. AND WHEN WE STARTED TO HAVE SEX, IT WAS THE KIND OF THING WHERE I WAS, LIKE, TOTALLY FREAKED OUT, I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA >> I FUCKED HER FOR A LONG TIME. I FUCKED HER FOR 43 MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING. NOBODY DOES THAT. THAT WAS A MARATHON FUCK. WHERE IT TURNED FROM TERROR TO PLEASURE, AND I REALLY BELIEVE YOU CAN SEE THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A TIME THAT I FELT MYSELF SLIP ON TO THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. >> UH, MARILYN, SHE PASSED OUT, SHE FAINTED. AND I-- IN MY MIND, I SAID, "SHIT, I'M GOING TO JAIL. I DONE KILLED THIS WHITE WOMAN WITH MY DICK." >> WELL, THE TRAPEZES WERE A BIT MUCH. IT'S A GOOD THING I WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF STANDING AROUND, LITERALLY, ON TOP OF PEOPLE, AND THERE WAS TRAPEZES AND WHATNOT. YOU HAD TO BE A GYMNAST, DEFINITELY. THE WAY THAT THE STORY OF-- WHEN "BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR" AND "IVORY SOAP BOX" CAME OUT, I TOLD THE MITCHELL BROTHERS THAT, "OH, BY THE WAY, I DID THIS COMMERCIAL FOR PROCTER & GAMBLE, UH, IVORY SOAP BOX." AND THEY'RE SAYING, "WHAT?" WE WALKED DOWN THE SOAP AISLES, WE LOOK, AND THERE IS MY MUG ON ALL THESE BOXES, STARING DOWN AT US, AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE VERY SAME WEEK THAT "BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR" OPENED IN THE THEATERS. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT I CREATED PORNO CHIC, BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS PART OF IT. AND THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE LIKE JOHNNY CARSON WERE WAITING IN LINE TO SEE "DEEP THROAT." IT WAS COUPLES, AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE GOING TO SEE ADULT FILMS AND GETTING >> YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M DEAD, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SEND ME UP TO HEAVEN OR DOWN TO HELL. >> I REALLY HONESTLY THOUGHT NOBODY I KNEW-- MUCH LESS ANYBODY I WAS RELATED TO-- WOULD EVER KNOW ABOUT IT. I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD. >> "THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES" WAS DEFINITELY AN ART MOVIE, AND I'M STILL NOT REALLY 100% SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE STORY WAS. BUT I STILL THINK IT WORKED. >> CAN YOU HELP ME? I-- I SEEMED TO HAVE LOST MY WAY. >> I'LL HELP YOU ALL I CAN, BUT YOU'RE NOT LOST. >> THEN WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE HERE. >> JERRY DAMIANO WAS THE SWEETEST GUY I EVER MET. HE LOOKED BACK OVER AT ME, AND HE SAYS, "CAN YOU COOK?" I SAID, "YEAH." HE SAID, "OKAY, YOU WANNA COOK ON THE FILM?" I SAID, "SURE." HE SAID, "I GOT SOMEBODY COMING IN TO READ THE PART OF THE DEVIL IN THIS FILM I'M DOING. WOULD YOU MIND READING WITH HIM?" AND I SAID, "SURE, I'D BE GLAD TO." I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. DOESN'T THAT COUNT FOR ANYTHING? AND HE LOOKS OVER AT ME, HE SAID, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY MISS JONES?" AND I SAID, "AND COOK?" HOW ABOUT LUST? >> LUST? >> YES, LUST. IT IS ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, ISN'T IT? >> HE OFFERED ME $100 A DAY TO DO MISS JONES. AND I SAID, "THAT SOUNDS GOOD." SO I WAS MAKING 125 A DAY, INSTEAD OF JUST 100. >> GEORGINA WAS AMAZING. HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, AND THE WAY THAT SHE FUCKED WAS SO PASSIONATE. LIKE, SHE-- SHE BROUGHT ENERGY TO ALL OF THE SCENES, AND IT REALLY, REALLY SHOWED. >> FOR THAT DAY, IT WAS A BIG BUDGET FILM. I THINK THEY WERE SPENDING SOMETHING LIKE $25,000. IT DIDN'T PUT MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE, BUT IT CERTAINLY DID OPEN UP AN INTERESTING CAN OF WORMS FOR MY LIFE. THAT SUICIDE SCENE-- EVERY ACTOR AND ACTRESS IN THE WORLD, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, WANTS TO PLAY A DEATH SCENE. >> A SUICIDE AT THE BEGINNING OF A PORN MOVIE REALLY SETS THE TONE. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY BRAVE TO START A MOVIE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SEX WITH DEATH. >> AH, HERMAN, HERMAN, THAT BEAUTIFUL, SWEET, AFFECTIONATE BOA, WHO COULD TURN AND LOOK AS FIERCE AS YOU WANTED HIM TO. WHAT AN ACTOR. IT WASN'T PLANNED FOR HIM TO BE IN THE FILM. AND I'M TALKING TO THE SNAKE ON THE BED, AND JERRY WALKS BY AND SKIDS TO A HALT AND SAID, "YOU'RE A SNAKE WRANGLER." HE SAID, "WOULD YOU DO A SCENE WITH IT?" MARKS SAYS, "$100 A DAY, SAME AS I GET." SO HERMAN WAS IN THE FILM. THE ANAL SCENE, WHICH EVERYONE, OF COURSE, ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT-- I DON'T KNOW-- IT'S-- IT'S A HUGE FANTASY IN EVERYONE'S MIND, I THINK, TO-- TO GIVE IT A TRY. AND WHEN IT GETS ALL BIG AND FAT AND HARD AND SLIPPERY, AND YOU COULD STICK IT IN MY ASS. GETTING FUCKED IN THE ASS IS JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF-- YOU GET USED TO IT. >> ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THE SEX SCENES WAS GEORGINA'S DIRTY TALK. >> CAN YOU FEEL HIS PRICK? CAN HE FEEL YOU? CAN YOU FEEL HIM? CAN YOU FEEL YOUR COCKS TOGETHER? CAN YOU, RUBBING AGAINST MY... >> IT SO ADDED TO THE SEX SCENE. THE DIRTY-- THE DIRTY TALK WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST THINGS OF THE MOVIE FOR ME. >> WHEN JERRY CALLED ME ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE DID THE FILM AND SAID, "I WANT YOU TO GO TO TORONTO FOR THIS GRAND OPENING--" IT WAS LAVISH, IT WAS ELEGANT, IT WAS COVERED BY A MILLION CAMERAS ALL OVER THE ROOM, AND SPLASHED ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND... I SAID, "WELL, SO MUCH FOR ANIM-- ANONYMITY NOW. I GUESS I-- I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS WHAT >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> MISTY BEETHOVEN. >> IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME? >> NO, IT'S NOT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD SOUND MORE IMPORTANT. >> WHAT WAS IT BEFORE? I WAS CAST IN "MISTY BEETHOVEN" AND I FLEW TO NEW YORK, AND I MET HIM, AND HE TALKED TO ME AND EVERYTHING AND TOLD ME TO GO BACK HOME AND TO GET EVERY BIT OF CLOTHING, EVERY PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD EVER BEEN TAKEN OF ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND BRING IT ALL BACK TO NEW YORK. >> AS HYMAN MANDEL ONCE SAID, "NEVER LET THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DOING IT WRONG STOP YOU FROM DOING IT RIGHT." >> WHO WAS HYMAN MANDEL? >> I DON'T KNOW. I READ THAT ON THE MEN'S ROOM WALL AT THE NEW YORK >> IT'S A TAKE ON GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S "PYGMALION" OR MODERN-DAY "MY FAIR LADY" OR EVEN "SHE'S ALL THAT," IF YOU'RE IN THE BUT IT'S TAKING THIS WOMAN, WHO IS, LIKE, A DIME-STORE HOOKER, BASICALLY, GIVING HAND JOBS IN MOVIE THEATERS. >> EXCUSE ME, MY GUM WAS IN FRONT OF YOU. >> HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT WAS YOURS? >> FIVE SEATS IN. FIVE'S MY LUCKY NUMBER. YOU AMERICAN? >> MOST OF THE TIME. >> FIVE BUCKS FOR A HAND JOB. I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE IN TEN MINUTES. >> TEN MINUTES? >> MM-HMM. TEN MINUTES. I HAVE TO MEET NAPOLEON. >> NAPOLEON? >> NAPOLEON. HI. YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME. >> JAMIE GILLIS WAS A SEXOLOGIST, AND HE WAS GOING TO TRAIN ME TO BECOME THE >> HE TAKES HER ON AS A PROJECT WHERE HE FEELS HE CAN TURN THIS LOWLY STREET GIRL INTO A >> MY DEAR, YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE NADIR OF PASSION, THE MOST UNEXCITING THING GOD HAS EVER CREATED, A SEXUAL CIVIL SERVICE WORKER. NOBODY NEEDS TO READ MY LAST BOOK MORE OR DESERVES TO BE IN MY NEXT BOOK LESS THAN YOU. >> IT'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE YOU'RE WATCHING THIS VERY INSECURE CONSTANCE MONEY GO FROM THIS VERY UNATTRACTIVE WIG AND MAKEUP TO THE END, WHERE SHE'S BASICALLY TAKING ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MEN IN TOWN AND PUTTING A STRAP ON AND FUCKING HIM WITH IT. >> I WENT UP TO SEE A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF RADLEY METZGER, WHO, UH, HIS NOM DE PORN BECAME HENRY PARIS. AND, UM, UH, INSTEAD OF BEING, UH, ON THE FILM, HE'S A BIT OF A SVENGALI, AND I WOUND UP BEING IN THE FILM. YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LET HIM MAKE THAT PERILOUS JOURNEY ALONE? IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT BEHAVIOR AND PROTOCOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE, UH, ON AN ADULT SET, SO IT WAS REALLY BREAKING INTO SOMETHING THAT BROKE ALL THE RULES. >> ♪ WISH I HAD HER BESIDE ME ♪ >> IT'S FUNNY-- I WASN'T EVEN AWARE-- IT WAS-- I WAS WATCHING THE FILM, BUT I WAS ROOTING FOR BOTH OF THEM TO BE TOGETHER UNTIL THE ACT-- END MOMENT WHERE SHE'S GIVING HIM A BLOW JOB, AND HE'S DEGRADING HER AS IF SHE'S NOT IN THE ROOM, UH, PRETENDING THAT SHE'S NOT THERE, AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS MOMENT WHERE THEY-- THEY COME TOGETHER. IT'S JUST-- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> YOU KNOW WHY MOST PEOPLE HAVE SEXUAL PROBLEMS? THEY TALK TOO GODDAMN MUCH! >> JAMIE IS A VERY SWEET PERSON ON ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A VERY DISTURBED INDIVIDUAL. JAMIE HAD HIS DEMONS. >> YOU INSTANTLY JUST ARE SO ENGAGED BY HIM. IN FACT, WHEN I STARTED WATCHING THE-- THE OPENING IN "MISTY BEETHOVEN," I WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT JAMIE GILLIS WAS A PORN PERFORMER. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO NOT HAVE ANY SEX IN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE HE WAS SO GOOD. YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, "HOW COULD THIS GUY BE A PORN ACTOR?" >> WORKING FOR RADLEY METZGER WAS, UM-- I DON'T REALLY KNOW. I-- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REALLY SAY IT-- IT COMES BACK TO THAT THING, "IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE..." >> OKAY, LET'S GET YOU UNDRESSED. NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T DO IT YOURSELF. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW, FOR ONE THING. >> HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T THINK I COULD ACT, AND THAT'S WHY HE PUT ME THROUGH EVERYTHING. THAT WAS HIS JUSTIFICATION. >> I THINK MEN STINK. >> WELL, THEY THINK YOU STINK. IN FACT, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST PERFECTLY BALANCED EQUATIONS IN NATURE. >> I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT MOVIE WAS MADE MORE WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT THAN MONEY. HE REALLY DID MAKE A MASTERPIECE. I'VE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE QUOTE LINES FROM IT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. >> IT HAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG STORY WITH BEAUTIFUL IMAGERY. >> AND, ALSO, I MEAN, LOOKING AT IT ALL THESE YEARS LATER, IT WAS ALSO-- I MEAN I LOOKED PRETTY GOOD, TOO. I THINK IT WAS ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WAS MORE REALITY THAN FANTASY. >> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON WITHIN THAT MOVIE THAT REALLY SAYS, "THIS IS AN ARTISTIC >> EXCUSE ME. UH, PARDON ME. DO YOU MIND IF I BLOW YOUR WAITER? >> NOT AT ALL. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO MINE. >> BARBARA BROADCAST WAS A MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS A SEX WORKER WHO WROTE A BOOK. IT'S TAKING PLACE AT A RESTAURANT, AND PEOPLE ARE GIVING BLOW JOBS AS IF IT'S NO BIG DEAL. NOBODY'S BATTING AN EYE, NOBODY'S LOOKING AT IT PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX ON TABLES. AND IT WAS WHAT I FEEL A TRUE ADULT SHOULD-- FILM SHOULD BE, WHERE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO JUDGMENT ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM. >> YES, WE'LL HAVE YOUR RESERVATION IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME. >> THERE'S A LOT OF JOKES IN "BARBARA BROADCAST." ONE OF THEM IS WHEN THE MAITRE 'D, UM, HE RECEIVES A BLOW JOB EVERY TIME SOMEBODY DROPS A PLATE OR MESSES UP. AND IT'S JUST SO CAVALIER IN THAT HE JUST UNBUTTONS HIS PANTS, AND THEY GET DOWN ON THEIR KNEES. >> WELL, BOBBY ASTER I REMEMBER VERY WELL, BECAUSE HE'S THE VERY FIRST PERSON THAT I EVER WORKED >> ANNETTE HAVEN'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND BE A SEXUAL WOMAN. >> MY BROTHER'S KIND OF SHY, AND, WELL, HE'S A BIG, BIG FAN OF YOURS. WELL, WOULD YOU MIND GIVING HIM AN AUTOGRAPH AND A LITTLE HEAD? >> ANNETTE, UM, WAS JUST, UH, JUST ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESSLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I HAD EVER SEEN, LET ALONE I THINK IT WAS THE-- THE FIRST RED BUSH THAT I HAD EVER SEEN. SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK AND A GREAT BUSINESSWOMAN, AND, UH, NUTTIER THAN A FRUITCAKE AS WELL. >> IN "BARBARA BROADCAST," METZGER'S USING THESE VERY WIDE SHOTS WHERE YOU'RE SEEING SEXUAL ACTIVITY HAPPENING WHILE THERE IS DIALOGUE HAPPENING BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS. THERE ALSO WAS ANOTHER JOKE IN "BARBARA BROADCAST" THAT I LOVED WHERE I BELIEVE IT WAS THEY ORDERED UP A NUMBER 17, WHICH, BASICALLY, WAS A MAN CAME ON A SALAD. >> HE DOES A WONDERFUL CAFE AU LAIT. >> IT'S CINEMATICALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE LOCATIONS, I MEAN, SHOOTING AT, UH, A RESTAURANT. I MEAN, THE KITCHEN SCENE WITH C.J. LAING WITH ALL THE STEAM AND THE POTS AND THE PANS AND THE THIS AND THE THAT AND... >> THEY TOOK A SCENE FROM "MISTY BEETHOVEN," I UNDERSTAND, AS A FILLER FOR THE GIGANTIC CLIM-- CLIMAX OF THE FILM. >> SO WE HAVE THIS LITTLE PET WORKING FOR US, AND TO SET HER STRAIGHT, WE LET CURLY AT HER, TO ACT OUT ONE OF HIS FANTASIES. JIMMY WASN'T VERY NICE TO ME WHEN HE FIRST MET ME. THE MAKEUP LADY, SHE KEPT PUTTING MORE HAIRPIECES IN MY HAIR, MORE AND MORE HAIRPIECES. SHE SAID, "WELL, I DON'T WANT HER BRAINS TO SPILL AND JAMIE SAID, "WELL, IF IT'S GONNA BE REALISTIC-- IF THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT, THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT. STOP PUTTING THOSE HAIRPIECES IN HER HAIR." I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. >> JAMIE WOULD CALL ME WHENEVER HE WAS IN KIND OF ONE BIND OR ANOTHER. HE SAYS, "MITCH, YOU'VE GOTTA COME HERE RIGHT AWAY. YOU'VE GOTTA COME RIGHT-- RIGHT AWAY," AND I HEAR THIS, LIKE, WATER SOUND, LIKE, THIS FLUSHING SOUND. HE'S LIKE, "HURRY, HURRY." SO I THREW SOMETHING ON, AND I JUMPED IN A CAB. I GET THERE, AND JAMIE WAS FUCKING C.J. FROM BEHIND, BUT HAD HER HEAD IMMERSED IN THE TOILET BOWL, AND SHE HAD A NECKLACE ON, AND THE CATCH GOT CAUGHT, AND SO HE HAD TO KEEP FLUSHING THE TOILET IN ORDER FOR HER TO GET AIR. AND I GOT THE CATCH FROM UNDERNEATH HER NECK, AND, UH, SHE COMES UP FOR AIR AND SAYS, >> I'LL GIVE YOU $10 IF YOU LET ME LOOK AT YOUR TITS. >> MR. GREENFIELD! >> PLEASE, PLEASE, I JUST WANNA LOOK AT YOUR PRETTY LITTLE TITS. >> YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL GOOD GIRLS. >> THE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME-- I'D WORKED FOR HIM QUITE A FEW TIMES-- I HELPED CAST SOME PEOPLE IN THAT FILM. I ALSO, UM, FOUND A WAY TO GET ACCESS TO BROOKLYN COLLEGE. AND WE KINDA KNEW WHEN THE FACILITIES WERE OPEN. WE-- IT WAS LIKE "DO WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN." WE JUST LUCKED OUT. WE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING. >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER ON SET WHEN BAMBI WOODS WAS ON SET. MAYBE I MET HER ONE TIME. SHE WAS, FOR THAT TIME, INCREDIBLY HOT-LOOKING. >> DEBBIE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? >> RAISE THE MONEY FAST. >> WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE, DEBBIE? >> IN TWO WEEKS. >> BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RAISE THE FARE. >> THE WORST THING ABOUT "DEBBIE DOES DALLAS" IS R. BOLLA'S THE ONLY GUY THAT GETS TO FUCK HER. YOU WANNA FUCK THAT GIRL. I MEAN, IT'S A COMPLETE TEASE. IT'S A-- IT'S A COCK-TEASING FILM, AND IT WORKED ON THAT LEVEL. >> SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT... >> OH! >> (WHISTLE BLOWS) >> THE DALLAS COWBOYS STARTED THE WHOLE CHEERLEADER CRAZE, AND IT REALLY WENT VIRAL. IF YOU COULD USE THAT WORD BACK THEN. AND SOMEBODY WAS SMART ENOUGH TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA IT WOULD BLOW UP LIKE IT DID. >> NO, MOM. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU. >> OH, DARLING, I'M SO GLAD. KIRDY STEVENS. WE MET-- WE MET AT A RESTAURANT IN, UM, WEST L.A., AND HE TOLD ME IT WAS ABOUT INCEST, AND I SAID, "NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT." >> I LOVED "TABOO" AS A MOVIE. IN FACT, THE ENDING WAS SO DISTURBING AND BOTHERSOME TO ME THAT SHE DIDN'T END UP WITH HER SON, IT MADE ME QUESTION MY OWN >> HE PERSISTED, AND THEN, UM, AGAIN, I-- I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THIS AS MY HIGHER SELF JUMPED IN AND SAID, "DO IT." BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DO IT. YOU-- IF YOU DO IT, YOU CAN BRING CONSCIOUSNESS AND QUALITY TO IT, SO DO IT. >> WE ARE CENSORING OURSELVES FROM DOING THINGS THAT ARE AS FREE AND AS OPEN AS THEY WERE 35 YEARS AGO. I MEAN THEY WERE MORE FREE 35 YEARS AGO. >> I HATED THE SCRIPT THE FIRST TIME I READ IT. IT WAS-- IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO, UM-- TO READ ABOUT INCEST IN SUCH A SORT OF FLIPPANT, UM, MANNER. BUT IT WAS SO WRONG. >> LOOK, MA, I DON'T THINK ANY LESS OF EITHER ONE OF US. IT HAPPENED, AND I GOTTA TELL YA, I WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. >> DON'T-- DON'T... NO, PAUL, DON'T. THE WORLD HAS A DIRTY WORD FOR THIS. >> THERE'S THESE-- THESE MOMENTS THAT KIND OF MAKE YOU SAY, "WHOA!" THESE JARRING MOMENTS, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN KAY PARKER IS IN THE KITCHEN, AND HER BREAST IS HANGING OUT OF HER SHIRT, AND SHE'S STANDING THERE WITH HER SON, AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERE'S NO COVERING UP, AND IT-- IT'S JUST, AGAIN, SEX IS OUT THERE. >> I MEAN I'M NOT EXACTLY OVER-THE-HILL, YOU KNOW. >> YOU'RE TELLING ME. >> YOU SEE IT A LOT WITH KAY PARKER'S FRIEND IN THE MOVIE, WHO IS HAVING ORGIES AND-- AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH-- SHE THINKS IT'S HOT IMAGINING THAT HER SON WOULD BE HAVING SEX WITH HER. SHE REFERENCES THAT KAY PARKER IS, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN KIND OF ASSAULTED BY HER BOSS. AND SHE'S ON THE PHONE WITH HER FRIEND, AND THE FRIEND SAYS... >> WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE? IS JERRY RAPING YOU? >> CUT THAT OUT, YOU SON-OF- A-BITCH! >> WHAT'S HE DOING? DOES HE HAVE HIS COCK OUT? >> BUT IT-- IT-- IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE FIND SEXUALLY AROUSING, EVEN IF IT IS NEC-- EVEN IF IT IS FORBIDDEN. >> WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THE-- THE SCENE, THE SEDUCTION SCENE WITH MIKE RANGER IN "TABOO," I-- I GET GOOSEFLESH-- I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW, AS I-- AS I GET READY TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I DO REFER TO IT AS A VERY, UM, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE. >> SHE'S JUST LEFT THIS ORGY PARTY THAT SHE FELT EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN, AND SHE JUST FINDS IT WITHIN HERSELF THAT SHE MUST HAVE SEX, AND HE'S SAFE FOR HER. HE IS SAFE. >> (GROANING) >> I LOST MYSELF IN THAT SCENE. I WAS NOT THERE. I SURRENDERED, IF YOU WILL, TO THE PART, AND THE PART, OR THE ROLE, THE MOTHER, JUST TOOK ME, UM, ON THIS TRIP. >> IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, YES, THIS IS THE NATURAL THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND I. THAT'S-- >> (INTERVIEWER) I'M APPALLED. >> THERE'S NOTHING WRONGER >> WHAT'LL IT BE, GENTS? >> OH, THE MASTER WILL HAVE A BEER, ANYTHING IMPORTED. >> BOTTLE OF BUFFALO PISS, PLEASE. >> THE AMERO BROTHERS MADE A BIG BUDGET COMEDY. WE JUST HAD A LOT OF FUN. I SWEAR, THE BURNING OF ATLANTA SCENE OR WHATEVER WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER >> NOW, REMEMBER, PAY NO ATTENTION TO ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU, JUST DO WHAT I SAY. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE SCENE I'D LIKE TO GET DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE WE ARE SHOOTING THE BOMBING OF ATLANTA THIS AFTERNOON. >> (ALL SCREAMING) >> IT WAS FUNNY AND QUIRKY. IT WAS-- IT WAS VERY HORNY, IT HAD SO MANY SEX SCENES. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. >> I DID IT IN A BOAT ONCE, AND I HAD TO DO ALL THE ROWING. >> R. BOLLA AND I ARE IN WYOMING, WHERE WE MEET THE CANE SISTERS. I DECIDE TO TAKE THEM TO NEW YORK WITH US, AND-- AND SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE, "WHAT, YOU GOT AN AIRPLANE?" >> ANYWAY, I'M TO BE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES, AND I'VE GOT THIS TERRIFIC GOWN RIGGED UP. >> A GOWN? ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE TRANSYLVANIANS? >> SUSIE MANDELL WAS THE-- MY FAVORITE OF THE TWO CHARACTERS. >> CANDY, WHAT'S A FILM LOOP? >> YOU'VE GOT ME. >> THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 46 GIRLS AND A MONKEY. >> IT WAS REALLY A TRIBUTE TO THE, UH, MGM MOVIES, ONLY WITH HARDCORE SEX. >> FUCK. >> THE RAPE SCENE WHERE THE YANKEES CAME IN AND, LIKE, BANGED ALL THE CHICKS. >> I WANT A CUM SHOT, OR NONE OF YOU FAGGOTS GET PAID! >> "BLONDE AMBITION" WAS PLAYING IN NEW YORK-- THE R-RATED VERSION AT ONE THEATER, AND THE X-RATED VERSION AT >> IT'S SANDY, AM I RIGHT? OH, BUT THERE IS AN AMAZING RESEMBLANCE. BUT NOW THAT I LOOK AT YOU, >> WELL, IS MY SISTER HERE OR NOT? >> "NEON NIGHTS" HAD A VERY VERONICA HART PLAYED A MADAME, AND I WAS KIND OF HER BOY-TOY, >> I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT, BABY. YOU'RE MY PRIVATE FUCKING >> THE FILM WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUCKED UP. UM, THE DAUGHTER IS LISTENING TO HER MOM AND HER MOM'S BOYFRIEND AND THEN SHE STARTS MASTURBATING WITH A HAIRBRUSH. AND THEN SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM, AND HE COMES IN, AND HE'S TELLING HER TO SHUSH AND TURN AROUND, AND HE'S GRABBING ON HER AND TOUCHING HER. >> NO. >> TURN AROUND, COME ON. TURN AROUND, BABY. THAT'S A GIRL. THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. >> WHEN JAKE TEAGUE MAKES LYSA THATCHER ELEVATE, THEY DID IT VERY WELL, LIKE, HE WAS PUTTING HIS ARMS UNDERNEATH HER BUTT AND OVER HER BOOBS AND OVER HER VAGINA AND, LIKE, DOING THE WHOLE CREEPY THING, AND THEN I LOVE HOW HE GOT IN HER MIND. HE WAS HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHILE HE WAS INSIDE OF HER MIND, AND SHE WAS FEELING EVERYTHING THAT HIM AND THE OTHER WOMAN WERE DOING. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. >> SO VERONICA, BACK HOME, IS TAKING A SHOWER, AND A LA HITCHCOCK IN "PSYCHO," UH, I ENTER-- BUT I HAD SOME FLOWERS-- AND I PULL BACK THE CURTAIN, AND SHE SCREAMS. >> (SCREAMING) ♪♪ (STRINGS SHRIEKING) >> GOTCHA! OH, MAN, WERE YOU EVER GOIN'! >> NO! >> PEEING IN YOUR PANTS, YOU WERE SO SCARED. >> YOU FUCK! >> SHE'S ALL PISSED OFF AT THAT, AND THEN WE GO OFF IN THE BEDROOM AND MAKE REALLY FRANTIC AND HARD, HARD SEX. >> I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL AT KEEPING THE PLOT TOGETHER AND MAKING IT AN INTERESTING MOVIE THAT IS, NOT ONLY RISKY AND DIFFERENT AND VERY INTERESTING WITH THE MAGICIAN AND HER HITCH-HIKING AND BEING IN LOVE WITH HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND, >> I WANNA GIVE IT A TRY. I DON'T WANNA LOOK BACK WITH REGRETS. YOU KNOW, IF ONLY I'D GONE TO NEW YORK, I COULD'VE BEEN >> THE PLOT OF "ROOMMATES" IS SHE HAPPENS TO BE A HOOKER, AND SHE DECIDES TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS. AND HER APARTMENT'S TOO BIG FOR HER, SO SHE CONSIGNS TWO ROOMMATES TO COME >> WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT-- >> ONE WAS, UH, A BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS MODEL, WHO, UNFORTUNATELY, SEEMED TO HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM AND GET IN AND I PLAYED A COLLEGE STUDENT WHO, ACTUALLY, I THINK, RAN AWAY FROM COLLEGE. I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY COLLEGE PROFESSOR, AND IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME AT ALL. >> MY CHARACTER HAD SOME BAD PEOPLE IN HER LIFE, AND, UH, STUFF HAPPENS BECAUSE I RUN RAMPANT, AND I KIND OF LEARN MY LESSON. WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE IN QUEENS. WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? >> THE FAMOUS RAPE SCENE FROM "ROOMMATES." SO MUCH OF IT WAS INFERRED. THE BACKS OF THE ACTORS WERE TO THE CAMERA. I WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR. >> RUB SOME ON HER FACE, SAL, RUB IT IN. MAKE HER EAT IT. >> AGAIN, YOU HEAR THE SOUNDS, YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE WORST POSSIBLE THING IS HAPPENING TO ME. JAMIE GILLIS COMES BURSTING IN, STARTS KNOCKING THE GUYS ASIDE, AND THEN JAMIE STARTS DOING JAMIE GILLIS. >> DID THEY HURT YOU? >> NO. >> LET ME SEE IF THEY HURT YOU. THEY STUCK THE BOTTLE-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH THE BOTTLE WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY SHOVED IT IN? >> HE'S NOT THERE TO HELP ME, HE'S THERE TO JERK OFF ON ME, YOU KNOW? SICK, TWISTED JAMIE GILLIS. >> HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN DEGRADING ANYBODY, YOU KNOW? CHUCK'S IDEA OF A GREAT TIME WAS TO-- TO HAVE FUN. >> (LAUGHING) COME ON, YOU GUYS ARE ANIMALS. TAKE A BREAK ALREADY. IT DIDN'T FIT INTO ANY CATEGORY. SO CHUCK REALLY WENT OUT ON A LIMB TO MAKE THIS. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES WHERE EVERYBODY WASN'T RUNNING AROUND, GOING "FUCK ME, FUCK ME, FUCK ME." >> IN THE END OF THE 1970s, THEATRICAL PORN FILMS BEGIN TO STRUGGLE. OBSCENITY PROSECUTIONS ROSE, ZONING LAWS HAD FORCED ADULT THEATERS INTO THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THE PORN CHIC THAT FUELED TICKET SALES DIED OUT. BUT THERE WAS A NEW FRONTIER OPENING FOR ADULT MOVIE PRODUCERS-- THE VCR WAS ABOUT TO REDEFINE THE PORN INDUSTRY >> WHEN DID PEOPLE START TO BUY VHS's? WHEN WAS THAT STARTING TO BE THE NORM VERSUS, UH, GOING TO THE THEATER? >> IN THE MID-'70s, THE MACHINES CAME OUT, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE GREATEST INVENTION AND THEY HAD TO HAVE ONE-- YOU HAD TO GO OUT. BUT, LIKE YOU SAID, THEY WERE EXPENSIVE. THEY WERE $1,000 A MACHINE. AND THE MOVIES THEMSELVES WERE $95. THEY WOULD HAVE PARTIES, THOUGH. THEY WOULD GO IN AND CHIP IN >> THERE WAS MORE WORK THAN-- THAN GIRLS IN THE BUSINESS. LIKE, THERE WERE, LIKE, 12 OF US REALLY IN THE BUSINESS, IT SEEMED, AND I THINK WE ALL I MEAN, IT WAS JUST-- THE-- THE PRODUCERS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH GIRLS. >> SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE SHOOTING-- WHAT WAS A DAY ONSET LIKE BACK THEN? >> UM, LET'S SEE, THERE WAS USUALLY A SCRIPT, LIKE, A 20-PAGE SCRIPT, WHICH ALWAYS IRRITATED ME, 'CAUSE I WAS NOT GOOD AT MEMORIZING THINGS. IT WAS ALWAYS SHOT AT, LIKE, A REALLY NICE HOUSE, THE LOCATION-- NOT ALWAYS, BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS, YOU KNOW, SHOT IN REALLY NICE HOUSES UP IN PORN VALLEY SOMEWHERE. THEY ALWAYS HAD CATERING, HAIR, AND MAKEUP. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE-- IN A WEIRD WAY, IT WAS KINDA LIKE BEING ON A REAL MOVIE SET, ONLY WE WERE NAKED HAVING SEX. >> YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE PLAYBACK AT-- ON THE SET. IT WAS LIKE A WHOLE NEW WORLD. BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT THE BEST. BUT EVERYBODY WANTED TO DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP, IT WAS QUICK, IT WAS PAINLESS. >> SO, AS A PERFORMER, WHAT... DID THE CONSUMERS SORT OF EXPECT FROM YOU? LIKE, WERE YOU GUYS SHOOTING A LOT OF CRAZY SEX ACTS? >> NUDITY. NO. >> OR DID THEY WANT YOU TO BE A GOOD ACTRESS? DID THEY CARE? DID THEY JUST WANNA SEE YOUR-- >> I THINK, IN 1984, THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH A FILM IN THEIR HOUSE OF A NAKED GIRL SUCKING A GUY'S DICK. LIKE, THERE WAS DEFINITELY NO CRAZY SEX ACTS LIKE THERE ARE-- I MEAN, IT WAS KINDA LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE TYPICAL THREE POSITIONS, HEAD, HIM EATING ME OUT, BUT IT WASN'T CRAZY SEX. I REALLY THINK, BACK IN '84, PEOPLE WERE JUST SO HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX >> GOOD EVENING, MUTANTS AND MUTETTES, AND WELCOME TO >> THE STORYLINE IS THERE'S BEEN THING AND, IN THE WAKE OF THAT, STILL STAND THE TOUCH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, AND THE REST OF THEM CAN'T. >> TRUST ME, FOLKS, I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, AND I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GET IT. NEED IS MY FIX, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. >> AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, HAVE SEX ARE FORCED TO STAGE THESE LIVE SEX SHOWS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX LIKE THAT. IT'S, LIKE, WEIRD AND EXPERIMENTAL, BUT THEN IT'S GOT THIS VERY OBVIOUS METAPHOR ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY AND ITS PLACE IN THE WORLD. >> LEAVING SO SOON, FRIEND? FEELING A LITTLE QUEASY? >> LIVE THEATER, ON THE OTHER HAND, AND THE HISTORY OF LIVE THEATER, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF WHERE "CAFE FLESH'S" REFERENCES PROBABLY CAME FROM. >> "CAFE FLESH" STANDS THE TEST OF TIME BECAUSE IT'S A PORNO ABOUT PORNO. IT, IT VERY MUCH IS WHAT IT IS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO WONDERFULLY HONEST ABOUT IT. BUT THEN IT'S GOT ALL OF THE OTHER LAYERS, SO IT REMAINS INTERESTING. I MEAN, YOU WATCH IT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES, YOU'RE STILL GONNA >> DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU FUCKING YOUR BEST FRIEND'S WIFE? >> (CHUCKLING) YOU'RE IN >> "SCOUNDRELS" WAS THE FIRST FILM TO WIN A BEST PICTURE AWARD AND HOWARD SAID TO ME, CECIL HOWARD, "YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRACK ONE JOKE IN THIS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE-- NO MUGGING TO THE CAMERA. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A HAM." >> RON JEREMY SCARED ME AT THAT TIME, UM... IT WAS, IT WAS REALLY ODD BECAUSE, BEFORE I HAD MET RON JEREMY, I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, UM, BUT HIS HEADSHOT TO ME LOOKED LIKE >> HOWARD WAS A TOUGH GUY. CECIL HOWARD WAS TOUGH. HE WANTED THINGS HIS WAY. BUT I RESPECT THAT. >> I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH CECIL HOWARD, AND HE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS, AND I WORKED FOR HIM >> EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIE IS VERY DARK LIT AND VERY DARK IN GENERAL. THE DRAMA OF THE MOVIE, I THINK, >> AH, I'M GONNA CHANGE. >> THAT'LL BE THE DAY. >> IT'S A FASCINATING PSYCHODRAMA. THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I'M IN CLOWN WHITE TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE. >> I'VE BEEN GOOD. I'VE BEEN REAL GOOD. FUCK IT, NOBODY TELLS THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME. >> EVERYBODY'S FUCKING EVERYBODY IN THIS MOVIE, BUT IT'S NOT A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY THING, YOU KNOW. THE DOCTOR IS CHEATING ON HIS, UM, HIS WIFE WITH HIS SECRETARY. AND, YOU KNOW, HIS SECRETARY'S CHEATING ON HIM WITH HIS BEST FRIEND WHO, I BELIEVE, HIS WIFE IS ALSO SLEEPING WITH. (SIGHING) AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER WHO FEELS INVISIBLE. >> MY PERFECT PARENTS. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. WHAT DO I LIKE? I LIKE MAKING LOVE. >> SO SHE'S TAKING IT OUT BY BECOMING A WHORE AND HAVING ALL THE SEX IN THE WORLD THAT SHE CAN. >> SHE'S THE GIRL AT THE CANDY STORE ON THE CORNER. THAT'S WHY I GET TO SEE HER EVERY DAY, AND THEN FINALLY, I JUST TELL HER TO HOP IN. SHE GETS IN MY CAR, AND WE'RE GONNA ESCAPE AND RUN AWAY. >> MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME I SHOULD MARRY A DOCTOR. (HORN HONKING) (SCREAMING) >> WE CRASH MY CAR AND DIE. WHICH IS CERTAINLY A STATEMENT AGAINST INFIDELITY, YOU KNOW? >> EVERYBODY HAS A DARK SIDE, AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO HIDE NO MATTER HOW PRETTY YOUR SURROUNDINGS ARE. AND THIS MOVIE REALLY DIGS INTO EVERYBODY'S SEXUALLY DEVIANT DARK SIDE. >> NO ONE FILMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. CECIL HOWARD, CHUCK VINCENT, RADLEY METZGER, HENRI PACHARD, ANTHONY SPINELLI ON THE WEST COAST, THESE GUYS MADE FILMS WHICH HAD SEX IN IT. >> BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> ELIZABETH. >> THAT'S A NICE NAME. >> SPINELLI, HIS NAME WAS SAM, HE WAS THE BACKBONE HE WAS MORE THAN, UH, A TALENTED DIRECTOR. HE WAS MAKING THE BEST MOVIES. AND HE BECAME A FRIEND AND A MENTOR. >> ANTHONY SPINELLI... >> WHO IS... >> HE WAS MY-- HE'S A DIRECTOR. HE'S MY DAD. IT WAS A GREAT TEAM. HE WOULD USUALLY SAY, "I HAVE AN IDEA." AND I'D GO, AND I'D WRITE THE ROUGH DRAFT, AND WE, UH, SHOWED IT TO HIM, AND WE-- GREAT COLLABORATION, >> THE PLOT OF "NOTHING TO HIDE" REALLY REMINDED ME OF "OF MICE AND MEN." AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FOR A PORN MOVIE. HOW TO BE A MAN. AND "LOVE'S FOR SUCKERS," HE'S TEACHING ME. AND I FALL IN LOVE, AND I WANNA MARRY. >> HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO LOVE SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> I THINK THAT THERE IS PARTS OF THIS MOVIE THAT YOU CAN JERK-OFF TO. >> SLOW AND DEEP. >> AS LONG AS YOU'RE INTO JOHN LESLIE. ONE OF THE SCENES IN THERE HAS SOMETHING FOR MOST PEOPLE TO JERK OFF TO. >> OH, JACK! >> I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN JERK OFF TO THE RICHARD PACHECO SCENE. >> NONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HAD COME BY FIT WHAT SAM WANTED TO COME OUT OF THAT CHARACTER. >> AH! WHY DON'T YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING?! >> SHE WAS PERFECT. >> THE SEX SCENE BETWEEN RICHARD AND CHELSEA WAS MY FAVORITE. IT WAS SO REAL. >> I SORT OF GOT MY-- SOME SPITTLE ON MY FINGER AND PLAYED WITH HER NIPPLE AND... "NO, NO, NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LENNY WOULD NEVER DO THAT!" >> SEE? >> OH, IS THAT A RUBBER? >> HOW'D YOU KNOW? >> I SAW ONE IN MY BROTHER'S DRAWER. >> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT IN A PORN MOVIE BEFORE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY STOP THE SEX TO PUT ON A CONDOM, AND THEY TALK ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM AND HOW SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, AND IT JUST-- IT WAS SO, SO REAL. I LOVED IT. >> THERE'S A GREAT AWKWARDNESS AND PLAYFULNESS ABOUT WINNING THIS, ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM 'CAUSE IT'S PLAYED, PLAYED REALISTICALLY. SPINELLI PLAYED THE OWNER OF A HOT DOG STAND. >> YOU DON'T FOOL ME. YOU DON'T WANNA STOP BEING A MOTHER AND A FATHER, RIGHT? >> HE AND JOHN HAVE A LONG SCENE WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS IS WHAT IT IS." YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE KID. WHEN AVN DID THEIR FIRST AWARDS, THEY GAVE ME BEST ACTOR FOR "IRRESISTIBLE", AND THEY ALSO GAVE ME BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR "NOTHING TO HIDE." THAT PROBABLY WAS THE >> FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, I'VE BEEN WRITING STORIES, NOT FOR PUBLICATION BUT FOR A VERY CURIOUS MAN, A PRIVATE CLITEROTICA. >> JANINE AND I BECAME BEST FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE 18 AND 19 YEARS OLD. AND I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US REALLY KNEW WHAT TO BE TOTALLY PREPARED FOR. I THINK SHE'D DONE SOME... SHE'D BEEN A "PENTHOUSE" PET SO SHE'D DONE SOME "PENTHOUSE" VIDEOS, BUT NOT EXACTLY THE HARDCORE WE WERE ABOUT READY TO GET INVOLVED IN. >> WORKING WITH ANDREW BLAKE, HE'S, UM... HE'S VERY UNDERSTATED, YOU KNOW, QUIET GUY, BUT HIS WHEELS ARE ALWAYS >> ANDREW BLAKE IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ARTIST. I MEAN, HE'S QUIRKY. HE'S INTERESTING. SOMEWHAT INTROVERTED. BIT OF A RECLUSE, UH, EXCEPT FOR WHEN HE'S FILMING, AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHEN IT ALL >> I HIRED THIS GUY TO MAKE THESE-- HE MADE, LIKE, >> AND BOY, AT THE BEGINNING, THERE'S SOME MIGHTY HEFTY ONES. THEY WERE QUITE BIG. >> AND WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE SET, HE WAS BLOODY, AND HE HAD CUT HIMSELF, AND HE NEEDED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AND HE DROPPED OFF THE DILDOS, AND, YOU KNOW, I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. (CHUCKLING) >> AND, OF COURSE, BY THE TIME WE WERE DONE, WE WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. >> I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ADULT INDUSTRY. AT THAT TIME OF MAKING "HIDDEN OBSESSIONS," I HAD NEVER HEARD OF VIVID. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BIG-BUDGET CONTRACT GIRLS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. >> I MEAN, BASICALLY, I'M ONE TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR. THAT WAS THE WRONG FIRST SCENE TO EVER DO. >> I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING, UH, STILL SHOOTING FILM. WHEN I'M 80, AND I'M STILL SHOOTING SOME 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AND I WANNA KEEL OVER, AND MY BOLEX GOES INTO HER PUSSY. THAT'S WHAT I ENVISION FOR >> WELL, I GUESS THESE ARE FOR IF YOU'RE LONELY AT NIGHT AND, UH, NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. >> YEAH. >> I TOOK THE IDEA OF "JUSTINE" FROM A FRENCH FILM BY, UM, A DIRECTOR NAMED LOUIS MALLE. IT'S ABOUT A FATHER WHO FALLS FOR HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. >> I SAID, I'VE SEEN IT. AND HE SAID, "WHAT'D YOU THINK?" AND I SAID, "I HATED IT." HE SAID, "YOU HATED IT, WHY?" I SAID, "BECAUSE OF THE MORALITY THAT THIS MAN WOULD DESTROY HIS SON AND HIS WIFE FOR THE SAKE OF >> IT WAS AN EVENT OF MY... SORT OF... HAVING A SON WHO'S IN SOME WAYS MORE GROWN-UP THAN ME. HE'S TELLING ME, YOU KNOW, >> WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. >> I'M THINKING ABOUT MY FATHER. >> YOUR FATHER? >> IN "DAMAGE", UH, JEREMY IRONS IS THE FATHER. HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. HE DIDN'T CARE. >> BUT IN OUR MOVIE, THE FATHER WOULD NOT DESTROY HIS SON. HE WOULD GIVE UP THE GIRL BECAUSE HIS SON IS HIS SON. >> MMM. WOULD YOU LIKE A TASTE? >> I LIKE OUR VERSION BETTER. >> ROXANNE BLAZE HAD A SERIES OF ENDLESS ORGASMS FROM A WATER HOSE I WAS SPRAYING HER WITH. AND THAT WAS VERY REAL, IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. >> SHE'S ONE OF HIS GIRLS, HE WOULD LOOK AND-- AND SAY, "WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?" WHY'D YOU COME BACK, HMM? >> BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE. BECAUSE YOU'RE DANGEROUS FOR ME. >> WE REALLY FELT WHAT WE WERE DOING-- YOU KNOW, WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY PORN. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE IT THE BEST PORN WE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE IT. >> "JUSTINE" DOES QUALIFY AS ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES MADE, UH, UH, BOTH IN THE HISTORY OF PORN, BUT IN MY PERSONAL HISTORY WORKING. IT WOULD BE IN MY TOP TEN >> MY CRIME WAS TO SHARE THESE VISIONS WITH YOU. THE TRUTH. AND FOR THIS, I HAVE BEEN >> "LATEX" WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE BUT THEN THERE WAS ABOUT 12 MONTHS OF POST MAKING ALL OF THIS STUFF, SO THAT MIGHT'VE THIS IS A WHOLE MOVIE FULL OF COMPUTER-GENERATED EFFECTS. THIS WAS SO FAR BEFORE ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR PORNO, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON A MICHAEL NINN FEATURE KNEW THEY WERE IN FOR A RIDE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WALK IN AND BE OUT OF THERE IN AN HOUR. UH, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A COUPLE OF HOURS JUST TO GET YOUR MAKEUP ON. HE SAYS THAT YOU CLAIMED TO BE ABLE TO "SEE INSIDE OF PEOPLE." DID YOU SAY THAT? >> YES. >> I'D CALL THAT E.S.P., WOULDN'T YOU? >> I WOULD CALL IT SEEING >> JON DOUGH REALLY TOOK HOLD OF THAT ROLE AND CREATED THAT ROLE ALMOST ON HIS OWN. UM, MICHAEL NINN MADE IT INTO VISUALLY POWERFUL MOVIE AND TECHNICALLY FAR SUPERIOR THAN MOST EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE THAT. >> YOU'RE ASKING ME TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MYSELF. >> HE WAS SO DEEPLY DEDICATED TO WHAT WAS GOING IN THERE, MORE THAN I EVER SAW HIM IN ANY MOVIE. >> THERE WAS ONE SET, THE KITCHEN SET WITH ZACK AND SUNSET THOMAS. THAT'S THE ONLY SET WE SHOT ON. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SHOT AGAINST GREEN SCREEN, WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD TO BE MANUFACTURED >> I'M IN THE KITCHEN, YOU KNOW, LATEX GLOVES ON. AND THERE'S THESE BIG, WHITE AND I WAS IN THE DRESSING ROOM. I WAS JUST ALL UPSET BECAUSE I WAS SO USED WEARING THESE LITTLE SKIMPY UNDERWEAR. I SAID, "MIKE, I CANNOT WEAR THESE GRANNY UNDERWEAR." >> MICHAEL NINN SEEMS TO DEAL MORE WITH, UM, BROAD SYMBOLISM, LIKE, SYMBOLIC STORIES. THEY WERE HUGE STORIES THAT TALKED ABOUT BASICALLY GOOD AND EVIL. THERE'S ALWAYS THE INNOCENCE THAT GETS CORRUPTED. THERE'S THE, THE SOCIETY THAT CHURNS UP THE INNOCENTS IN ITS GEARS, IT'S-- IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC AND BROAD IN ITS SCOPE, AND I THINK ANDREW BLAKE WAS MORE ABOUT INSTANCES. >> HOME VIDEO BECAME SUCH A POPULAR FORMAT FOR PORN THAT, BY THE MID-90'S, ADULT THEATERS WERE ESSENTIALLY A THING OF THE PAST. PRODUCERS TRADED NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO FOR SUNNY L.A., AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BECAME THE UNDISPUTED CAPITAL OF THE ADULT BUSINESS. VHS AND THE INDUSTRY SEEMED LIKE A MARRIAGE THAT WOULD LAST FOREVER. BUT PROGRESS NEVER STANDS STILL. AND A POWERFUL NEW FORMAT WAS ABOUT TO BRING NEW OPTIONS AND >> WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY PURSE? >> TO FIND YOUR BADGE. YOUR FIREMAN I.D. >> YOU'RE THE KIND OF GIRL WHO TAKES OUT PERSONAL ADS. "OH, HOT-BLOODED BLONDE >> IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER "BACKDRAFT," THAT BIG FIREMAN AND WHEN IT CAME TO "FLASHPOINT," WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS WE HAD KIND OF STARTED TO ELEVATE OUR ADULT MOVIES INTO WHAT WE THOUGHT SEX OUT OF THEM, BECOME KIND OF LIKE THAT "B" MOVIE VIBE. >> I JUST WISH I HAD IT HAD A STORYLINE. AND IT HAD REAL ACTING. >> FOR ITS TIME, IT WAS A HUGE MOVIE, AND, UH, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, I JUST HAPPENED TO MEET A BIG PYROTECHNICS GUY WHO WORKED IN THE MAINSTREAM. >> THEY ACTUALLY WORKED ON "BACKDRAFT." >> WHEN WORKING WITH FIRE, OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS A HUGE AMOUNT OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ESPECIALLY WITH THE MAINSTREAM GUY DOING IT ALL, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SAFETY MEETINGS ALL THE TIME. >> AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A FIREFIGHTER. SO THEY HAD ME CARRYING DUMMIES UPSTAIRS. >> I THINK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE STARTED THINKING THEY WERE GONNA PASS OUT RUNNING UP AND DOWN STAIRS WITH ALL THE GEAR ON. >> STEVENS, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? >> SHH! >> IF THE CAPTAIN CATCHES YOU, YOUR ASS IS HISTORY. >> I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW INCREDIBLY REAL THIS WAS GOING TO BE. WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SEX BEHIND FIRE, YOU DON'T REALLY REALIZE THE FEAR THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE FEELING. >> WE REALLY ONLY HAD ONE HUGE FIRE DAY, AND HE HAD A HUGE CREW IN THERE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND REALLY HAD A GRASP OF WHAT THE ISSUES WERE WHEN IT CAME TO SAFETY AND ANY, UH-- AND KEEPING THE ACTORS OUT OF DANGER. >> I REALLY THINK THAT WE-- WE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND SOMETHING >> TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DIDN'T EXACTLY INHERIT MY FATHER'S SIN... >> IT WAS NOT A HIGH-BUDGET MOVIE. OVER FIVE DAYS FOR 70 GRAND. SO 2-1/2 DAYS, $35,000... IT'S NOTHING FOR FILM. >> TO ME, IT WAS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER ONE-- YOU KNOW, THE FILMS WERE HERE AND THERE, JUST FEW AND FAR >> DIDN'T YOU APPLY AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS OR SOMETHING? >> YEAH, I GOT ACCEPTED, TOO, BUT I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE YET. >> THE ACTORS THAT CAME ON REALLY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, I GOT GOOD PEOPLE WITH ACTING CHOPS. SHANNA McCULLOUGH WHO, YOU KNOW, LATER WON AN AWARD FOR IT FOR BEST ACTRESS. >> THIS WAS A FILM NOIR AND IT WAS A DETECTIVE STORY AND HE WANTED ME TO STAR IN IT. IT'S A STORY OF TWO DETECTIVES AND THIS WOMAN WHO'S A FEMME FATALE KILLER. AND SHE'S, YOU KNOW, SEDUCING MEN AND THEN KILLING THEM. AND SHE'S BEEN STALKING MY PARTNER. APPARENTLY, HIS FATHER DEALT WITH THIS ALSO FEMME FATALE IN HIS CAREER AS A POLICEMAN. AND HE THINKS IT'S THE SAME WOMAN AND SHE'S STILL AROUND AFTER 50 YEARS. AND I SAID, "NO, IT MUST BE HER DAUGHTER." >> THE LOOK OF "LOOKER" IS VERY GRITTY AND NOIR INSPIRED AND THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. I WANTED TO DO A MOVIE THAT COULD'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE 30s. >> HE WAS A REAL SLAVE DRIVER. HE LITERALLY WOULD WORK A 24-HOUR DAY IF THAT WAS WHAT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST AND HE WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE. >> WHEN WE SHOT THAT MOVIE, WE KNEW WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL. >> WE PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT AND NIC PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT, AND WE DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT MUCH ANYMORE SO IT REALLY FELT GOOD THAT IT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT WE REALLY WANTED IT TO BE. >> EARLY ON IN THE SHOW, SHANNA WON FOR BEST ACTRESS. AND WE WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE, "COULD THIS BE?" AND THEN JUST THE FLOODGATES JUST OPENED UP AND WE WON BEST FILM DIRECTOR FOR ME, BEST FILM, ART DIRECTION, SCRIPT, EDITING. I MEAN, TRIFECTA, SWEEP. SO IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER >> DOGS LICK. MEN FUCKING EAT PUSSY. EAT MY PUSSY. >> "SEVEN DEADLY SINS" WAS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE FOR THE VIGNETTE STYLE OF SHOOTING. I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYTHING DISTINCTLY, UH, REPRESENTED BY THE SIN ITSELF. >> WHERE AM I? >> YOU STUPID BITCH. >> THE BASIC STORY IS A CRISIS OF THIS WOMAN WHO'S IN LOVE WITH THE REAL JANINE. AND SHE'S BEEN TOLD THAT SHE ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKS LIKE JANINE, BUT OF COURSE, WE HAVE A REALLY DOWDY VERSION OF HER. SO THE CHALLENGE WAS HOW DO WE >> IT WAS A STRETCH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH... I WAS JUST KIND OF... IT'S HARD NOT TO JUST EMBRACE HER. SO, UH, TO TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION AND BE LIKE, "YEAH, IT'S ME AND IT'S ME," >> YOU KNOW, THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE HAD TO HIDE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOOT AND BE SOMEBODY, AND YOU CAN'T SHOW YOUR FACE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO IT WASN'T EASY. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. >> YOUR A WHINY, DRIED-UP OLD MAID. >> SHUT UP! >> THAT NOBODY WANTS. >> SHUT UP. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF FOOD. THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF-- (GIGGLING) IT'S A PERFECT SCENE IF YOU'RE A FOOD FETISH KIND OF GUY. >> WE HAD TO BUILD SUPPORTS FOR THESE-- I THINK THEY WERE TEN-FEET TALL-- AND WE DID AN ARC AROUND THAT. AND THEN SET THAT IN A STAGE THAT, AT THE TIME, I THINK WAS BLACK. SO WE COULD, YOU KNOW-- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY GOT A TURNTABLE FOR THEM TO HAVE SEX ON SO THAT COULD REVOLVE, SO THE IMAGE BEHIND IN ALL THE MIRRORS WAS REVOLVING AT THE SAME TIME. IT HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF A SURREAL DEPARTMENT STORE >> HEY, WATCH THE TEETH, SWEETIE. >> SORRY, FORCE OF HABIT. >> "DARK ANGELS" CAME OUT-- SCOTT TAYLOR, THE OWNER OF NEW SENSATIONS. HE GOES, "I'VE ALWAYS REALLY KIND OF LIKED HORROR MOVIES AND STUFF AND VAMPIRE-TYPE STUFF." AND I SAID, "WELL, WE CAN DO >> YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL TONIGHT? >> IT DEPENDS, YOU A COP? >> YOU SEE A BADGE, SWEETHEART? >> WHEN I CONCEIVED THE WHOLE STORY AND WAS WRITING THE SCRIPT AND EVERYTHING, MIKE HORNER WAS ALREADY CAST IN MY HEAD. >> WE HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME PREPPING AND SETTING UP FOR THE BLEEDING SCENE THAN WE DID ON THE ENTIRE SEX SCENE, BECAUSE IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS FOR THEM TO THEY HAD TO CLEAN THE CAR ONE TIME FROM ALL THIS BLOOD-- ALL OVER THE WINDOWS. IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR >> I WAS JUST GETTING TO THAT. >> WE DIDN'T GET STARTED DOING THAT SCENE UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. AND WE WENT TILL LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING, 5:00 IN THE MORNING. WE GOT OUT OF THERE JUST IN TIME FOR THE SUNRISE. >> WHEN I APPROACHED SYDNEE TO DO THE MOVIE, I SAID, "ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, WE'RE GONNA DO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FULL-BODY CAST OF YOU, PROSTHETICS." 'CAUSE THAT'S HER IN THE MONSTER SUIT AT THE END. AND, YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING CONTACTS AND ALL THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THIS? >> AND I'M LOOKING AROUND THE WAREHOUSE AND THINKING, "MAN, YOU KNOW, I'M WORKING IN THIS WAREHOUSE AND, YOU KNOW, I'M A NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE PALLETS THAT LAY HERE ALL OVER, BROKEN." "AH, I'LL NEVER FALL ON THAT." IN THE DUMPSTER, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? PALLET, RIGHT, RIGHT? A PALLET AND BROKEN GLASS. >> JEWEL DE'NYLE WAS THE CONTRACT GIRL, AND SHE ACTUALLY QUIT, UH, FIVE DAYS BEFORE WE FINISHED SHOOTING. SHE STORMED OFF THE SET. IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SHOT THE END ALREADY. IT BROKE A LOT OF RULES WHEN IT CAME OUT. IT UPSET SOME PEOPLE, IT EXCITED A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT MADE A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW? IT WAS-- IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GREAT EXPERIENCES THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DUPLICATE, EVEN WITH BIGGER BUDGETS, BIGGER CREWS, NEWER EQUIPMENT, EVERYTHING. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MAGIC THAT WENT INTO >> YOU TRIED TO GET MY ATTENTION. >> YES. >> WELL, YOU DID. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR DVD. ANYTHING ELSE IMPRESS YOU >> I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE, UH, THE SCRIPT WAS THE BEST SCRIPT THAT I THOUGHT I HAD EVER COME UP WITH IN TERMS OF INTERESTING IDEAS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WRITE IT. (SHRIEKING) >> TO BE DIRECTED BY JOHN, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS MOVIE, WAS SO SPECIAL FOR ME I WAS A BIG FAN OF ALL THE "BUTTMAN" SERIES. I WAS A BIG FAN OF JOHN, SO IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A DREAM. >> I HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH MY CINEMATOGRAPHER WHO SAID, "WELL, WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO GIRLS?" AND I SAID, "OH. THEY COULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP." THAT'S MORE THAN JUST THE GIRL IN THE BACK ROOM TRYING TO SEDUCE ROCCO. >> MY ENGLISH AT THAT TIME WAS HORRIBLE, LIKE, BARELY ANY ENGLISH. ROCCO SPEAKS FRENCH VERY WELL SO HE WOULD TRANSLATE SOME OF THE THINGS, BUT THE FUNNIEST PART WAS-- WAS THE DIALOGUE I HAD, I WAS BASICALLY DOING IT-- DOING IT-- PHONETICALLY. >> I TOLD YOU THEY ARE STILL IN THE DARK AGES. I'M ALREADY NOT A GREAT ACTOR TO START WITH, BUT HERE, IT WAS LIKE-- LIKE ROBOTIC ACTING. >> I'LL DO THIS THING ABOUT THIS LITTLE FASHION COMPANY 'CAUSE I WANNA DO STUFF WITH FASHION 'CAUSE I LIKE CLOTHES AND SEXY CLOTHES ON GIRLS. IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE, AND I'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE MOUSEY GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER AND SHE'LL JUST-- SHE'LL REALLY BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE OPERATION. AND WE'LL DO THIS LIKE NORMAL, LIKE TV SHOW KIND OF THING. BUT THAT MORPHED INTO A FETISH FASHION COMPANY AND THE GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER WAS BELLADONNA WHO SENDS THE GUY SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE AN EXTREME S&M DVD WHERE HE FINDS THIS STUFF WITH EASTER EGGS ON THE DVD. IT MORPHED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY LIKE A PRIMER FOR S&M SEX. WHEREAS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD THING, BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD SOMEHOW. 305 ROLLS OF FILM AS I RECALL. AND MOST OF THOSE WERE THE FOUR MINUTES, ALTHOUGH, WE DID HAVE ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS, WE HAD THE BIG CAMERA WHICH COULD SHOOT 11 MINUTES AT A TIME WHICH WAS SO GREAT, 11 MINUTES. I DON'T THINK I'VE DONE MY BEST MOVIE YET, THAT'S FOR SURE. I HOPE TO BE DOING MY NEXT MOVIE IS GONNA BE MY BEST MOVIE, >> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY? >> I'D LIKE A MASSAGE. >> WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. >> I MADE THE ORIGINAL "MASSEUSE" IN ABOUT 1990 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT WAS REALLY A DEPARTURE >> HELLO, THIS IS JIM. >> I THINK IT IS THE BEST I FELT SO INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE SCRIPT, >> THE DIRECTNESS, THE SIMPLICITY, THE TRUTHFULNESS OF IT. THERE'S NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. IT'S JUST A MASSEUSE AND HER CLIENT TALKING. YOU KNOW, WHAT DID I CALL IT-- "MY DINNER WITH ANDRE" OF X-RATED MOVIES. >> IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE CLOSELY, YOU CAN ALMOST SEE ME, THE REAL ME, DISCOVERING MYSELF. SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT SO MUCH. HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> 28. >> GIRLFRIEND? >> CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET? >> SURE, I LOVE SECRETS. >> I'M A VIRGIN. >> I LIKE TO STAB AND SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO. PAUL THOMAS HAS A WAY ABOUT HIM, AND I THINK I GAINED A LITTLE BIT OF HIS RESPECT. HE'S USED TO BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE POP, POP, POP, POP, POP. AND I WOULD BE LIKE, "LISTEN, NO, THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE, AND THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?" >> SHE BROUGHT A LOT TO THE TABLE, SHE LISTENED TO ME, ALWAYS ON TIME-- I'M THE ONE WHO HAD TO STEP UP MY GAME. YOU KNOW, WITH JENNA, NO PARTYING, YOU KNOW? >> I'LL SEE YOU LATER, >> I PLAYED JUSTINE JONES, JONES," AND JENNA JAMESON PLAYED THE DEVIL, WHICH WAS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE I GOT THE SCRIPT AND THEN HEARD THAT AND MY-- MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO REMAKE THIS AMAZING CLASSIC FILM, "THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES," BUT ALSO NOW NEXT TO JENNA JAMESON >> AT FIRST IT FEELS LIKE A NO-WIN SITUATION, YOU KNOW? WHAT AM I GONNA MAKE ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET "GODFATHER TWO," BUT MOST OF THE TIME, THE SEQUEL'S JUST AREN'T SO GOOD IF THE ORIGINAL'S >> I HAD BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME. AND PAUL THOMAS CALLED ME ONE NIGHT AND SAID, "WE'RE GONNA DO A REMAKE OF 'THE DEVIL AND I SAID, "WELL, VERY GOOD, PAUL, CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD LUCK," AND SO FORTH. AND HE SAYS, "YOU'RE GONNA BE IN IT," AND I SAID, "OH, NO, I'M NOT." AND HE SAID, "OH, YES, YOU ARE." HE SAYS, "YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO A CAMEO, THREE LINES." I SAID, "I DON'T EVEN WANNA LEARN THREE LINES." HE SAYS, "I'LL GIVE YOU $10,000," I SAID, "OKAY." >> WHEN SHE COMES OUT AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE, YOU GET CHILLS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS. IT REALLY WORKS, AND, UH... SHE'S JUST DELIGHTFUL. >> DO YOU READ, MISS JONES? >> ONLY ROMANCE NOVELS, IT'S MY JOB. >> YOU ARE SO PRIVILEGED. AND YOU FEEL SO SORRY FOR YOURSELF. IS ONE OF THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING WOMEN EVER. OWNING HER SEXUALITY AND NOT BACKING DOWN AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS FAME-- UBER FAMOUS. I HAVE ULTIMATE RESPECT FOR HER, AND I MADE SURE I TOLD HER THAT. AND HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, TOO. >> IT WAS REALLY COOL TO DO THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME, WE WERE THREE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE BUSINESS, AND IT WAS LIKE, "WOW, THIS >> WHILE I'M GETTING DP'D, I SAY THIS MONOLOGUE FROM-- THAT GEORGINA SPELVIN SAID IN THE ORIGINAL "MISS JONES." >> IF YOU TOUCH ME, I'LL COME, I KNOW I WILL. TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME. I'LL MAKE YOU COME, TOO. SO WHEN I DID HOWARD STERN, HE SAID, "WELL, DID YOU FUCK A SNAKE," BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THE ORIGINAL MISS JONES. THEY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH, BUT THEY REMEMBER THE SNAKE SCENE. AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY REMEMBER ABOUT IT, BUT THEY THINK MOSTLY THAT THERE WAS A SEX SCENE WITH A SNAKE. SO I WENT TO VIVID AND I SAID, "LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO A SNAKE SCENE." >> IT WAS A GOOD TIME IN EVERYONE'S LIVES. THEY WERE TIGHT. VIVID WAS TIGHT. WE WERE ALL TIGHT AND WORKING-- REALLY WORKING BOTH FOR "THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES" AND FOR "MASSEUSE", WORKING AT THE TOP OF OUR PROFESSIONAL LEVELS AND OUR PERSONAL LIVES. WE'RE ALL PRETTY DAMN TOGETHER. SO IT WAS NOTHING BUT-- NOTHING BUT POSITIVE. >> THE 2000s WERE THE DECADE WHEN PORN GREW UP. FLUSH WITH MONEY FROM THE DVD BOOM, PRODUCERS BEGAN SHOOTING BIGGER MOVIES WITH MAJOR BUDGETS, GIGANTIC CASTS, AND ELABORATE SCRIPTS. THESE ADULT BLOCKBUSTERS NEEDED A BETTER FORMAT THAN SIMPLE VIDEO, AND FILM WAS BECOMING TOO COSTLY TO JUSTIFY. COMING WITH ITS OWN SET OF TECHNICAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS, THE FAST-GROWING HD FORMAT >> THE FEATURES OF THAT TIME, WERE PEOPLE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON THEM... >> YEAH. >> WHEN IT WAS NEW, WERE THEY-- >> YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE, FIRST FEATURE LEADS WAS FOR "WICKED." IT WAS THIS REALLY BIG, LIKE, MICHAEL RAVEN MOVIE. I REMEMBER IT HAD, LIKE, THESE OOZING, LIKE, TENTACLE DILDOS AND FOG MACHINE, AND, LIKE, THESE BIG SETS AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW, WE SHOT OUT IN THE DESERT AND IT WAS, LIKE, A WIND STORM AND IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY FUN TO GO FROM, LIKE, JUST GETTING, LIKE, YOU KNOW... >> NAILED. >> FUCK-NAILED ON A GONZO SET, JUST POUNDED, LIKE, "YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, COME ON, I CAN TAKE IT," YOU KNOW, TO, LIKE, CATERING. (LAUGHING) YOU KNOW, LIKE, "WOULD YOU LIKE A SNACK?" "YES, I WOULD." >> THERE'S BREAKFAST ON SET? >> SO HOW HAS INTERNET AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY TODAY? >> I THINK IT MAKES THE FANS ACCESS YOUR FAVORITE STARS AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND GIVE THEM GIFTS AND, YOU KNOW, JUST TO TALK TO WHOEVER YOU'RE A FAN OF. SO THE INTERNET, LITERALLY, THEY CAN SEE WHO'S SHOOTING WHEN, THAT DAY, THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA COME OUT. IT'S JUST, LIKE, RIGHT NOW, >> I'M LOOKING FOR A PIRATE. >> WE KNOW MANY, MANY PIRATES. >> BY FAR, THE BIGGEST PRODUCTION THAT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN HAD TO BE THE "PIRATES." SHOT STUFF IN L.A., THEN TOOK THE WHOLE TROOP, CREW, EVERYBODY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN IT ALL THE WAY TO FLORIDA. WE SHOT ON THE U.S.S. BOUNTY. IT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO SHOOT >> HELMSMAN, PREPARE TO SET SAIL. >> ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LET HER GO UNSCATHED, SIR? >> OF COURSE NOT. >> WORKING WITH JOONE, HE HAS A VISION, HE'S AN ARTIST. HE HAS THIS GREAT VISION OF SOMETHING BIGGER >> THERE'S SOME DIRECTORS THAT ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED IN THEIR STUFF, THEY HAVE THE VISION IN THEIR HEAD, AND JOONE IS ONE OF THOSE DIRECTORS. HE ALREADY HAD THE SET IN HIS HEAD AND THEY BUILT IT AND THEY TOOK THEIR TIME TO DO IT AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED. ALREADY HAD THE SHOTS IN HIS HEAD. >> IT'S A BIT SLOW TONIGHT, IT'S AWKWARD. >> LINE UP THE CREW ON THE BOW. BRING ME THE PASSENGERS FROM THE DECK BELOW. AND, SERENA, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOUR METHODS, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER KILLING >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER A CRUEL PIRATE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO WATCH THAT AGAIN... UH, WAS I A CRUEL-- SHE WAS A HORNY PIRATE. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS CRUEL. >> WELL, THERE'S THE VICIOUS LADY I REMEMBER. >> DON'T EVER SECOND-GUESS ME. >> HE BUILT THE TENSION. SO WE WERE, OF COURSE, THE LAST SCENE OF "PIRATES." HE JUST WAITED, AND THEY WOULD SAY LITTLE THINGS TO US TO LIKE GET US READY AND TURNED-ON AND READY TO GO. >> THEY KEPT JESSE JANE AND I SEPARATE, UH, SEPARATED JUST SO THE TENSION AND THE, YOU KNOW, THE ANTICIPATION WOULD BUILD UP AND... >> AND HE'S COME TEASE ME. "I WONDER WHO'S GONNA WIN? I GUESS SHE'S GONNA SHOW YOU." >> SHE'S ABOUT HALF MY SIZE AND THIS LITTLE-- THIS LITTLE CUPCAKE THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA... DOMINATE ME? I HAD TO-- I HAD TO PUT HER IN HER PLACE, BUT I LET HER PRETEND TO THINK THAT FOR A LITTLE BIT. >> OKAY, SO CARMEN GETS PUT-- CHOKED OFF THE BOAT BY TOMMY GUNN. >> AND THEY WANTED TO DO THIS STUNT WHERE, UH, STUNT GIRL GOES OFF IN THE WATER, NO BIG DEAL. >> AND SHE GOES, "NO." >> WELL, JESSE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. SHE WANTED TO DO THE STUNT HERSELF. >> AND OF COURSE, I'M A DAREDEVIL, SO I'M LIKE, "I'LL DO IT." >> AND I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS. SO I ALREADY GOT MY STUFF OFF, GOT MY BOOTS OFF, AND I'M JUST STANDING HERE AND JUST WAITING FOR HER TO JUMP IN. AS SOON AS SHE JUMP IN AND THEY GOT THE SHOT AND THE SPLASH, I'M IN THE WATER AFTER HER. THEY'RE NOT EVEN THINKING THAT THIS BIG, BALLOONING DRESS IS JUST GONNA SUCK UP RIGHT TO HER, AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO KICK, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. >> WELL, MY DRESS, HER DRESS, GETS CAUGHT ON A NAIL UNDERNEATH THE BOAT AND I START SINKING AND I CAN'T COME UP. >> BUT SHE WENT IN AND SHE ALMOST DROWNED. >> I THINK SOME OF THAT WAS BEHIND-THE-SCENES, NOT ALL OF IT WHERE I WAS DROWNING, 'CAUSE THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT GOOD. I DEFINITELY DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE AS BIG AS IT WAS AND THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER. AND PEOPLE WHO EVER WATCHED PORN HEARD OF THE MOVIE AND WENT TO WATCH IT. IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE TO BE CUT INTO A RATED R VERSION AND RENTED IN BLOCKBUSTER. IT WAS A BLOCKBUSTER HIT. >> YOU MUST THINK ME A MONSTER. >> "CORRUPTION" WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST BIG-BUDGET MOVIE I WAS THAT INVOLVED IN. I'D, YOU KNOW, BEEN IN OTHER BIG-BUDGET MOVIES AS TALENT, BUT YOU'RE NOT AS INVOLVED YOU SHOW UP AND, YOU KNOW, YOU PRETTY MUCH DO YOUR THING >> IT WAS SOMETHING BEING DONE AND BEING DONE WELL AND WITH, LIKE, HEART. THAT, LIKE, ATTRACTS ME. YEAH, I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME. >> I ALSO HAD A PRETTY DECENT ACTING ROLE. AND THAT WAS PLAYING THE PART OF CAROLYN HELMS, WHO WAS THE SENATOR'S WIFE. AND SHE'S KIND OF THE CENTRAL PART OF THE MOVIE. HERE'S CAROLYN IN THE MIDDLE, AND SHE'S KIND OF STARTS MANIPULATING EVERYBODY >> I'M A UNION LEADER, A TEAMSTER. AND I'M A-- I'M TRYING TO WORK, TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE. WORD IS YOU'RE PLANNING A RUN AT THE BIG TICKET IN TWO YEARS. IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MONEY, US, AND GOD ON YOUR SIDE... IN THAT ORDER. I'M BEING BLACKMAILED IN THIS SCENE, SO I'M-- SO I'M DOING-- I'M PERFORMING A SEXUAL ACT THAT IF I GET CAUGHT, MY OWN CAREER WOULD BE DONE. SO I WAS-- IT WAS ANOTHER SCENE OF HUMILIATION FOR ME, WHICH I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IN MY OWN LIFE WITH TWO MARRIAGES BEHIND ME. >> HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY PUSH ME OUT OF THE CAR? HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY ALMOST HIT ME WITH THE CAR? >> I THINK THEY WERE JUST HAVING FUN THROWING JAMES OUT OF A CAR. >> I HAD TO BE LIKE LIMP AND GET THROWN OF THIS CAR, UM, ONTO A PILE OF GARBAGE. >> I THINK THEY MUST'VE SHOT THAT SCENE. FOR WHATEVER REASON, LIKE 15 TIMES. >> IT FELT LIKE FOREVER 'CAUSE I'D BEEN PUSHED OUT OF THE CAR IN TO GARBAGE. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME WHERE, UH, MY LEGS FELT A LITTLE WEIRD AND, LIKE, EVERYONE STARTED SCREAMING 'CAUSE THE CAR ALMOST ROLLED OVER MY ANKLE. >> IT WAS FUN, IT WAS FANTASTIC BECAUSE WE'D ALL WORKED SO HARD ON IT AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS SENSE OF FAMILY AND HARD WORK, AND THE MOVIE JUST LOOKED INCREDIBLE. AND THEN WE WON. AND I REMEMBER JUMPING UP WHEN WE WON AT THE AVN AWARDS AND I HAD A CORSET ON AND I WAS SO EXCITED AND I ACTUALLY PEED >> WOW. THAT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO GOD I'VE EVER FELT. >> I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S... IT'S A LOT BIGGER AND A LOT IT WAS MY FIRST LEAD, BIG FEATURE FILM LIKE THAT. I HAD DONE THE SMALLER ONES WHERE I WAS LIKE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. BUT THIS WAS LIKE-- IT REALLY PUT ME ON THE MAP AS FAR MY PARTNER DIES, LIKE, IN THE LINE OF DUTY. I'M DEVASTATED. BUT I'M KIND OF LIKE A HARD-ASS, TOO, AND I DON'T LET ANYBODY KIND OF SEE MY EMOTIONS. AND WE DISCOVER THIS HACKER GIRL, WHICH WAS PLAYED BY HILLARY SCOTT. AT THAT POINT, SEXY PICTURES HAD JUST SIGNED HILLARY TO UNDER CONTRACT. AND THEY TOLD US WE HAD TO USE HER. IN THE END, HILLARY DID AN AMAZING JOB. SHE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW... SHE WAS PREPARED AND SHE CAME AND WHO AM I KIDDING? SHE DID NOT WORK HARD AT ALL. SHE DIDN'T, I'M LYING TO TRY THROUGH THE MIRACLE OF EDITING AND GOOD ACTING COACHING, I THINK THAT SHE FILLED THE ROLE FINE. >> DAVID, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. >> SHOWED UP ON SET AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, THIS IS A BIG MOVIE, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "YEAH, YOU'RE LIKE THE STAR OF IT." I'M LIKE, "BUT I'M ONLY HERE FOR A DAY." AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WELL, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT THE STAR OF IT, YOU'RE JUST-- THE WHOLE >> YOU SEE A LOT OF MOVIES IN PORN WHERE THEY SAY, "WE SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS, WE SPEND $2 MILLION," WHATEVER THE CASE IS. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT FOR THE MOST PART, THEY LIE. PEOPLE WILL SAY, "WE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY," AND THEY USUALLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. NOW LET ME TELL YOU, "UPLOAD" COST $350,000. THAT'S AN UNHEARD OF AMOUNT OF MONEY IN PORN. WE SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER KNOWN A PORN MOVIE THAT SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. >> WHEN "UPLOAD" WON ALL THE AWARDS, PICKED UP PRETTY MUCH ALMOST EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AT AVN'S, I FELT LIKE SUCH A STRONG FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED FROM ELI CROSS IS HE SAID, "THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU NEED, YOU NEED MONEY AND TIME. AND THOSE TWO THINGS WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU WITH A BETTER MOVIE." WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAD AND TURN IT INTO TIME, AND THAT MADE FOR A BETTER MOVIE. >> WHATEVER YOU ASK... I AM YOUR SERVANT. "FALLEN" TO THIS DAY IS IN "FALLEN" I AM A GUARDIAN ANGEL AND MY CHARGE IS JENNA HAZE. (EXPLOSION) >> NO! I THEN LOSE MY WINGS, AND I'M SORT OF ROAMING THE EARTH IN LIMBO IF YOU WILL. AND I PRETTY MUCH HAVE SEX WITH EVERYONE IN MY PATH. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT FANTASY REALM, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AND A LOVE STORY AT THAT WITH ALL THIS FANTASY STUFF WITH ANGELS AND FLYING AROUND ON ROOFTOPS, IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY >> OH! OH! >> A LOT HAS CHANGED. I'M NO LONGER AN ANGEL. "FALLEN", I THINK WE SHOT IT OVER TWO WEEKS, BUT IT WASN'T EVERY DAY OF THOSE TWO WEEKS. WE HAD PREP DAYS AND THEN WE HAD DOWN DAYS, SO-- SO PEOPLE COULD REST THEIR PARTS, YOU KNOW? WE HAD A LOT OF REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE IN IT. IT HAD ACTING, IT HAD A REALLY GREAT STORYLINE. IT HAD A LOT OF SEX. IT HAD A LOT OF HARDER SEX, TOO. >> A LOT OF "FALLEN" TAKES PLACE ON ROOFTOPS, AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN CAMERA. I'M-- I'M SCARED OF GREEN SCREEN MYSELF. I THINK "FALLEN" STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. IT'S A GREAT STORY. IT KIND OF PROPELLED JESSICA INTO THAT SUPERSTAR STATUS. AND, UH, DIDN'T DO BAD FOR ME AS A DIRECTOR, AS WELL. THE REAL REASON TO DO "FALLEN" WAS TO KIND OF HAVE JESSICA HIT THAT OTHER LEVEL. AND IT'S GREAT IF YOU CAN PUT HER IN THIS GREAT MOVIE. BUT IF THE SEX FALTERS, THEN IT'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T DONE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH YOUR STARLET BY TAKING HER >> WHAT HAPPENED? >> NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE. THEY CALL IT THE BIG BURN. AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY, >> WHEN I THINK OF A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD, UH, IT'S MORE THAN JUST BROKEN DOWN BUILDINGS. THERE'S A PRIMAL ELEMENT TO IT WHERE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM EACH OTHER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, AND LIFE BECOMES CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH >> MY CHARACTER WAS BASICALLY BEING SEX TRAFFICKED IN POST-APOCALYPTIC, UH-- I DON'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY I MEAN, JUST POST-APOCALYPTIC EARTH. >> YOU A BUTCHER NOW, TOO? >> SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE PRINCE. HE GETS FIRST LOOK AT ALL MY TRADE. >> "THE 8TH DAY" WAS CONCEIVED BY ME WITH AMBER RAYNE IN MIND AS THE LEAD CHARACTER. SHE IS THE SCRUFFY TANK GIRL IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. BUT IT WAS PERCEIVED BY EVERYONE THAT KAYDEN, BEING ADAM & EVE'S CONTRACT GIRL, WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW. AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS THE BOX COVER, BUT SHE IS THE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. AND, UM, WHEN AWARDS TIME CAME OUT, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. AMBER GOT SUPPORTING ACTRESS NOMINEE AND KAYDEN GET, YOU KNOW, ACTRESS NOMINEE. >> "THE 8TH DAY" WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST MOVIE I'VE EVER WORKED ON. THERE WERE SOME DAYS WHERE WE HAD STARTED THE DAY BEFORE. THERE WERE EXAMPLES IN THE MOVIE OF, UM, LIKE A MARKETPLACE, LIKE A BAZAAR THAT WE HAD TO BUILD WHERE PEOPLE WERE HAWKING JUNK OR THEY WERE HAWKING FOOD OR CLOTHES, THINGS THAT THEY'D SCAVENGED. >> THAT WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AS FAR AS ART DIRECTION WAS CONCERNED. THE ART DIRECTOR, KYLIE IRELAND, SPENT WEEKS RUNNING AROUND L.A. FINDING STUFF TO DO THERE. MY FAVORITE KAYDEN MOMENT, UM, IN THE WHOLE SHOW WAS WHEN SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BREAK DOWN AND CRY ABOUT HER DAD. >> IT WAS BEFORE I LEARNED HOW TO CRY BY MYSELF. >> AND CAN'T GET ANY TEARS TO FLOW AT ALL. WE WAITED A GOOD LONG TIME, AT LEAST A HALF AN HOUR. I WALK BACK IN AND I SAID, "YOU GOT NOTHING?" SHE GOES, "NO, NOTHING BAD'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME." >> I THINK THEY SQUIRTED CITRUS JUICE OR SOME SORT OF CITRUSY FRUIT IN MY EYES TO MAKE IT GO. >> SHE SAID, "HOLY SHIT, LET'S SHOOT RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE GOD DAMN IT, THIS BURNS." AND I SAID, "PERFECT." >> MY DAD DID THIS. (CRYING) ALL OF THIS. >> AND SHE GOES, "WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?" I SAID, "FUCK YOU, YOUR LIFE'S PERFECT." NO WONDER YOU CAN'T CRY. >> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AFTER THE BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS THAT WENT INTO IT, IT WAS REALLY A NICE PAYOFF. IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS. IT WASN'T JUST US, YOU KNOW, FUCKING AROUND IN THE DESERT. 'CAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT >> HOW DID MY FATHER DIE? >> A YOUNG JEDI NAMED DARTH VADER, WHO WAS A PUPIL OF MINE, OFF AND LEFT HIM BURNING IN A RIVER OF LAVA. >> "STAR WARS" IS PROBABLY THE AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO PARODY IN IT, SO, UM... WE REALLY DID-- WE REALLY DID, THAT COULD BE HAD, EVERYTHING SINGLE REFERENCE THAT WE COULD HAVE, AND RECREATING A LOT OF THE SCENES. IT WAS REALLY A LOT OF FUN. IT'S A LOT OF WORK, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. >> SHOOT FIRST, SHOOT OFTEN. SORRY FOR THE MESS. HAD TO KNOW "STAR WARS" TO ONE, GET THE HUMOR. TRYING TO GO WITH IT AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH STILL KIND OF TRYING TO STICK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT. >> THE THING THAT ALL THE FANS WOULD ASK ME IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I ANNOUNCE THE MOVIES, LIKE, OKAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE GIRL IN "STAR WARS." YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PORN MOVIE-- TO THIS DAY, PEOPLE WRITE ON YOUTUBE, THEY WATCH, YOU KNOW, THEY READ ABOUT IT LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE ONLY ONE GIRL? IT'S NOT TRUE, WE FOUND OTHER GIRLS THAT ARE PART OF THE "STAR WARS" UNIVERSE. THE GIRLS IN THE CANTEEN, I MEAN, THERE'S-- THERE'S A TON OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER, IT'S WAS REALLY INTERESTING. >> YOU CAN FIND SEX IN ANYTHING. I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE OR THE THEME HAS TO BE SEXY TO MAKE IT SEXY. THAT'S OUR JOB, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE THINGS THAT AREN'T SEXY SEXY. >> DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED, YOUR HIGHNESS. >> I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M DISGUSTED. WE SAT IN A ROOM AND HE TALKED INTO A POT. WE RECORDED ALL HIS SOUND IN A GIANT POT, LIKE A SPAGHETTI POT. IT WAS HILARIOUS. >> EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA. AND IN "STAR WARS" IT WAS LIKE CHI CHI LARUE. >> I'M SAVED! OVER HERE. HEY, SAILOR! >> C-3PO HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY METROSEXUAL, AND I FIGURE WE TAKE IT, YOU KNOW, TO PARODY THAT, TO EXPLORE THAT. >> "STAR WARS" WON A TOTAL OF EIGHT AWARDS AT AVN WHICH IS THE MOST THAT ANY PARODY HAS EVER WON, AND I THINK THAT'S AMAZING. IT'S CRAZY, UM, AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING ABOUT THAT IS MOST OF ALL THAT-- ALL THE WORK FOR THE MOVIE WAS DONE BEHIND-THE-SCENES, WITHOUT THE SETS, WITHOUT THE COSTUMES, WITHOUT THE TIME AND DEDICATION FOR THE SCRIPT. THE SHOOTING, THE ANGLES, THE GREEN SCREEN, THE POST PRODUCTION. THE MOVIE WOULD'VE BEEN NOTHING. AND I THINK, UM, YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY SHOWS AND, YOU KNOW, BY WINNING EIGHT AVN AWARDS, IT DEFINITELY SHOWS THAT OTHER PEOPLE APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD >> MOST KNOW ME AS DEATH. >> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? >> I'VE COME FOR YOU. >> THE BASIS BEHIND "UNDERWORLD--" I PLAY A CHARACTER NAMED TANYA, AND I HAVE BEEN WITH MY FIANCÉ AND WE HAVE MADE THE SWEET LOVE, TO DRIVE ME HOME, WE'RE IN HIS PARKING GARAGE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'RE VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT MUGGING. >> SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR BOYFRIEND. >> NO, PLEASE! >> THE OPENING IS, UH, A BIT DRASTIC AND A BIT BLOODY AND VIOLENT, UH, BUT WE ACTUALLY WENT BACK AND FORTH ON HOW VIOLENT TO MAKE IT. >> AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAVE MY LIFE, I'M PUT UNDER ANESTHESIA. AND WHEN I GO UNDER ANESTHESIA, THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS THAT, GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ME FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO ME IN THE UNDERWORLD. >> IF YOU REALLY WATCH THE MOVIE, EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH IS-- HAS A MIRROR IMAGE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE UNDERWORLD BELOW. EVERYTHING'S KIND OF TIED IN AND EVERYTHING'S, UH, GOT A YING AND A YANG SORT OF THING. >> XANDER CORVUS PLAYS SLICE AND HE WAS SORT OF, UH, HE HAD SCALPEL FINGERS AND HE WAS UP ON STILTS AND SO HE WAS THE SCALPEL THAT WAS STARTING THE SURGERY. >> THIS JOURNEY THAT YOU'VE EMBARKED UPON IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS SELF REACTING TO THE WORLD AROUND IT. >> THE NURSE WAS PASSING THE GAUZE TO THE DOCTOR. DURING MY OPERATION IT FELL. AND AS IT DROPPED, YOU SEE AN AERIALIST FALL OUT OF THE SKY >> SO ME AND JESSICA DRAKE GOT TO HAVE SEX ON WATER, OR IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS DIRECTLY ON THE WATER, BUT IT WAS WAS BUILT AND, UH, THERE WAS MAYBE LIKE AN INCH OF WATER ON TOP OF IT. >> AND I'M BLOODY IN A SHALLOW POOL OF WATER FOR LIKE EIGHT HOURS THAT DAY. >> WHEN THE INTIMIDATION MELTED AWAY WAS WHEN SHE STUMBLED ON A FEW OF HER LINES AND LAUGHED AT HERSELF. AND THEN YOU REALIZE, LIKE, SOMEONE'S A HUMAN BEING, AND THEY'RE A NORMAL PERSON AND... THAT'S OKAY. >> OH, I LOVE HAVING SEX WITH ASA AKIRA. RIGHT BEFORE THE SCENE, WE'RE TAKING PRETTY GIRLS AND I'M LIKE, "OH, THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY FUN." WE JUST SORT OF GOT ON EACH OTHER AND ROLLED OFF THE SET. WE DID IT EVERYWHERE. LIKE, WE WERE JUST HAVING SEX, SO, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO, UH, >> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT? >> I MEAN, WHAT ELSE IS THERE APART FROM LUXURY? >> THAT CAN'T BE A SERIOUS QUESTION. >> AN INDIE PORNO, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT. IT'S-- IT'S LIKE A REAL MOVIE WITH EMOTION AND ACTING IT'S PORN WITH A REAL STORYLINE. >> WHY DID YOU COME? >> I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN. >> WHY DID YOU COME AFTER FIVE FUCKING YEARS? MY CHARACTER, HER NAME'S JACKY. SHE'S THE BADASS. SHE'S DEFINITELY THE BADASS OF THE MOVIE AND SHE, UH, IS TRYING TO OPEN THE OTHER LILY UP TO THIS WORLD >> MY ROLE IN "WASTELAND" WAS VERY SIMPLE. THERE'S TWO GIRLS AT THE BAR. I SAY SOMETHING IN THEIR EARS WHICH IS EASY FOR ME. TAKE HER UP TO THE BATHROOM AND HAVE SEX WITH LILY LABEAU IN THE BATHROOM. IT'S A VERY, VERY CLOSED ENVIRONMENT, IT'S LITERALLY REAL TOILET SO THERE WAS NO ROOM TO OPEN THE DOOR, SHOOT, LIKE, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR. THEY SHOT IT ALL FROM ABOVE. I THINK HE KNEW THAT THE BEST WAY TO USE ME IS NOT TO HAVE ME SPEAK BUT LET ME JUST FUCK. >> I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT SEPARATES "WASTELAND" FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER PORN IS THAT THE SHOTS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND THEY ARE THOUGHT OUT. EVERY SINGLE SHOT IS THOUGHT OUT AND PLANNED TO JUST-- >> IT WAS REALLY, REALLY DARK, UM, WHERE WE SHOT THAT SCENE, FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SHOT ANYTHING IN SUCH DARK LIGHTING. IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY DARK. I WAS LIKE, "REALLY, LIKE, CAN YOU GUYS REALLY SEE WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING?" THEY'RE LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, IT LOOKS COOL." >> IT'S THIS WHOLE STORY COMBINING TO MAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL JUDGMENT HAD REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. AND RIGHT WHEN MY GUARD WAS FULLY DOWN, IT SUDDENLY HAD POPPED BACK UP. >> EMMA GOES INTO INTERVIEW A MAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM FITZGERALD WHO IS THIS VERY PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN WHO EMPLOYS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALES. THERE'S AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION PROPOSITIONS HER FOR THE ROLE OF BEING HIS SUB. SHE'S NOT A VERY SEXUAL PERSON. SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T CONFORM TO NORMAL SOCIETY'S VIEWS >> I DIDN'T READ THE "50 SHADES OF GREY" BOOK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER JACKY WE WANNA DO PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. >> I READ "50 SHADES OF GREY" AND I HATED HOW THE FEMALE PROTAGONIST WAS PORTRAYED. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY WEAK AND HER ENTIRE MOTIVATION WAS TO PLEASE A MAN AND TO MAKE A MAN HAPPY. I WANTED TO SET ABOUT WRITING A BDSM STORY THAT REALLY EXPLORED A STRONG WOMAN'S SUB ROLE AND HOW THAT CAN BE SO EMPOWERING FOR HER. >> SHE WAS, UM, LIVING, LIKE, A KIND OF RESERVED LIFE AND NOT REALLY BEING HERSELF, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN VERY MUCH RELATE TO BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO JUST, LIKE, BE THE PERSON THAT EVERYONE WANTED ME TO BE. >> BDSM IS NOT JUST BEATING SOMEBODY AND HARMING SOMEBODY AND PHYSICALLY HURTING THEM. IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE MENTAL ASPECT OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO FOR ME, I WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT THAT. >> I DID FEEL LIKE, UH, I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE JOINING THE MOVIE BECAUSE I HAD SOME BDSM EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT BONDAGE COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY. SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN A LITTLE BIT OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE WITH THAT FOR A MOVIE THAT SO MUCH, LIKE, REVOLVES AROUND THE BDSM COMMUNITY. >> SO "THE SUBMISSION OF EMMA MARX" WON BEST BDSM MOVIE AT AVN. AND I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED BECAUSE WE'RE UP AGAINST BDSM COMPANIES. AND NEW SENSATIONS MAINLY IS A FEATURE GONZO STUDIO THAT DOESN'T REALLY FOCUS ON ANYTHING PARTICULARLY HARDCORE. >> I WAS REALLY FLATTERED THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT FILM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THE PHYSICALITY THAT WAS EXPLORED. IT WAS THE MENTAL ASPECT. >> WHEN I FIRST STARTED, WE WERE DOING FILM, IT WAS A THRILL. IT WAS GREAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE LUGGING THESE BIG ASS CAMERAS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVING A FIELD DAY. NOBODY BOTHERED US, NOBODY CARED, YOU JUST DID THE MOVIES. AND THE DRUGS WERE GREAT. AND VIDEO CAME OUT AND IT WAS-- IT WAS A SMALLER PARTY. YOU DIDN'T NEED THE CREW YOU HAD FOR 35 MILLIMETER. YOU HAD WAY SMALLER CREW, AND YOU WOULD JUST SORT OF LOAD IT IN A VAN, SHOW UP AT A LOCATION, SHOT YOUR FOUR OR FIVE SCENES AND RAN OUT THE DOOR, YOU WERE DONE. AND THE DRUGS WERE OKAY. AND-- AND TOWARD THE END, IT REALLY JUST GOT, "HOW FAST CAN YOU CRANK IT OUT AND GET IT BACK TO ME AND I GOTTA PEDAL IT..." AND THE DRUGS SUCKED. >> IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE PORN INDUSTRY WILL GO FROM HERE. THE INTERNET ERA SEEMS TO DEMAND A RETURN TO THE LOOPS AND VIGNETTES THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE EROTIC FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S A SHAME TO THINK THAT THIS LIST OF THE GREATEST ADULT MOVIES MAYBE THE LAST OF ITS KIND. BUT THE FUTURE IS HARD TO SEE. AND MAYBE THE ADULT FEATURE WILL SURPRISE US WITH ITS LONGEVITY. I'M CHANEL PRESTON, GOOD NIGHT. ♪♪ >> IF THE BRILLIANT SWEDISH FILMMAKER INGMAR BERGMAN EVER MADE AN X-RATED MOTION PICTURE, IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. >> "PRISONER OF PARADISE" STARS SUCH FILM GREATS AS SEKA.
