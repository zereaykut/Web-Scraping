We just hit a million. - [Ethan's mom] Whoo! - [Messenger trilling] [emoticon chuckles on speaker] [Charlie] I'm gonna kick some ass. - I'm gonna kick some ass. - [Ethan's mom] Charlie! Be careful or someone might kick your ass. [Chuckles] Charlie, do not say that. We don't kick people's asses. - [Crying] - Here you go, Grandma. [Music playing loudly] Hey, are there any more comments about me? Everyone's loving your voice, Mom. Seriously. I am so sorry about that. I'll take it right off the bill. Hey, dude, where are you? At my house. What's up? Hey, table ten said their shawarma was overdone. That is the third time this week. If you do it again, I gotta tell my dad. Okay? No, dude, where are you exactly? I'm obviously at my fucking house with my mom, Tariq. Why are you being so weird? I want you to remember where you were the day your whole life changed. [Heavy breathing] [Ray sighs] I can't believe this is it. Our last fest together. [Shannie] Mmm. That's right. [Ray] Well, we should talk about it. - I better keep packing. - Hmm? [Sighs] [grunting] [chuckling] Come on. Two more minutes, please? Hey, you don't have to pack everything anyway. It's not like you're not coming back. [Shannie sniffles] Mmm. - Right? - We need to get up. Need to get up. You know, lots of couples make it through periods of long distance. If... if they want to. They just announced a last-minute add to the lineup. You're never gonna guess who it is! All right, bae, ready to pop your rave-- Oh, no. You're not wearing that. You look like a nun. [Chuckles] Okay. ["All I Ever Wanted" playing] [Neil] You're not sick of that fucking song yet? No, dude, this track is tight. It's so good. You know what I am sick of, though? Is this cheesy '90s shit. No wonder we're going out of business. You know? You know what? Maybe if you were more focused, we wouldn't be going out of business. Did we put this up or did someone sneak in and put this up in... I don't remember. Yeah, I'm focusing, for sure. I can't believe I'm going to fucking XOXO. It's like I'm making up for shit I did in a past life. Dude, this is the best part right here. This is... This is my favorite part. Neil, right here? So good. - [Baby crying] - [sighs] I'm sorry, can you say that again? I think I just had an aneurysm. [Chuckles] I said, I managed to book you a slot. You're gonna DJ at XOXO... in eight hours. Avilo is gonna be there. Dude, we're gonna be able to feel the bass. No Avilo, no Martin Garrix, no fest. We're gonna take the bus, we're gonna go right to the festival, we're gonna drop everybody off, then come back. That's it. Ugh! You're nasty, man. I'm not nasty, dude. I'm just trying to make money. And I have to recount it now because you keep talking. [All cheering] Yeah! Jesus! You think they'd make you assemble your own setup from scratch? I just want to be prepared. This is XOXO, not a party at someone's mom's house. Dude, I got you so hooked up, you're probably not even gonna have to touch your stuff. They'll have minions to do it for you. Hey, seriously though, man... I was able to book you because you deserve to be there. Once all those people hear your tracks, it's gonna be, like, on. They're not gonna hear my tracks. Except for "All I Ever Wanted." I'll play that last. What? They're not ready, Tariq. You know that. These are the rough tracks for the record label guy. Don't lose them. Seriously. Dude, I got this. Everything's taken care of. What's that smell? Don't freak out, but I just gotta make a few deliveries. What do you mean deliveries? My dad fired Mo. [Chuckles nervously] No. No. - [Stammers] No, don't worry. - Dude! I only have to cover his lunch shift till 2:30, 3:00 at the latest. Dude, how am I supposed to get there? Where are we even going right now? I got you a seat on this party bus, man. - I'll get there right after you, I swear. - A party bus? Seriously? How can you do this to me? You're gonna make me go alone? Party buses are great. You can pass out your promos to people, get them to come to the show-- Don't you have that meeting with the label guy that you're supposed to go to? If you go back to work, there's no chance that your dad lets you out. That is a definite. [Scoffs] Oh, my God! My God, dude. This is a sign. This is a total sign. There's no chance I can go. This whole thing's a trap. A trap? Dude, what do you think they're gonna do? Lure you out to steal your shitty synthesizers and your 2007 Acer? Just trust me. I've gotten us this far. You are gonna play an amazing set and I am gonna be there. - We're in this together, just like always. - [Sighs] I promise. Everything's going to be fine. Yes! Whoo! Oh... beautiful. - [Rave girl] Hi. - Hey. Do you have somewhere I could store these? Yeah. Bottom of the bus. But they'll get crushed. Happens to butterflies every day. [Girls scream] Whatever. Hey, is there Wi-Fi on the bus? Dude... kill yourself. Come on, let's go. No, it feels like it's missing something. Did you pack my fog machine? No. We don't need that. There's bigger issues. There was a dead raccoon in the storage compartment. Are you serious? Did it look natural? How bad was it? No, it hung itself. Come on, let's go. It was depressed because we didn't fucking leave yet. [Squeaky] All right, party people! Are you ready for XOXO? [Passengers cheering] [squeaky] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it is now time to rave. We should take these right before we get in. Stretch it out a little longer. I know, but I can't believe this is the last time we're gonna be doing this-- Hey! Stop! Stop the bus! [Passengers cheering] Eat, sleep, rave, repeat. [All chanting] Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! - [Darla] Your soul mate? - I just have a feeling, you know? He sent me this song and it was like he knew me. Like, he knew it would be the perfect song to send me. Krystal, everyone's listening to that song. Aw, little Krystal wants a soul mate. What do you want with a soul mate? You know we're going to a huge party? There's gonna be endless hot guys for you to choose from. Like, a candy store of dudes. That's cool that you like candy, but I want chocolate. The kind you save for a special occasion, and eat slowly. I don't think it's that crazy. Most of our parents met when they were our age. - Yeah, and now they're all divorced. - Come on, don't give her shit. I've got a soul mate I'm meeting up with, too. Maybe you guys have heard of him. His name's DJ Avilo. [Chelsea and Nikki screaming] - [Nikki] XOXO, here we go! - [Girls screaming] [cell phone ringing] Hello? Hi. Yes, this is Tariq Hariri, Ethan Shaw's manager. Yeah, I was supposed to meet with Mr. Henderson at 6:00, but... if you can believe this, there was some strange noise in the engine of my plane, so rather than risk it, we decided to take the limo. No, out of all of my clients, Ethan Shaw is my favorite. Okay. I'm sorry, the limo is a little bit loud. No, no, we'll still be there. We just might be a little bit late. Great. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. - Come on. - [Mr. Hariri] Tariq! What are you doing? We have customers! I, uh... I... Sorry. [Sighs] [laughing] Oh! Dude, who're you texting? Hey, bro! Bro, who're you texting, man. Come on. Let me in, man. Let me in on your secrets. [Laughing] Yo, bro. Yo, I came correct to this shit. Brought sensations for all occasions, my friend. Dude, check it. I'm gonna get started with these little Vicodin babies here, and top that off with these pharmaceutical-grade THC caps... later on, if you're interested. Oh, and the mushies are for whenever the sun... Ah! That's dumb, man! I'm sorry. I'm actually trying to work on something right now-- Dude, I'm gonna save the molly for right before Avilo, so it's, like, crazy intense. - [Shannie] What is he doing? - [Drug guy] Know what I'm saying? Poor fucking guy. Consider the fact that the universe is infinite. Hey. Hey, do... do you wanna sit with us? We have room. [Chuckles softly] One second. - Thanks. I needed that. - [Shannie chuckles] No, I didn't come to this with anybody. I feel like... Oh, very nice. Listening to Ethan Shaw. - Yeah. - We're pretty stoked about it. We think he's gonna be the best thing at the fest. So good. You guys are fucking with me, right? Aren't we supposed to go that way? No way, girl, we're VIP. Darla got us that sweet hookup. [Girls cheering] Oh, don't worry, Krystal. Jordan will still be there. We promise. - [Girls cheering] - [Chelsea] XOXO! - [Indistinct chatter] - [chuckling] Oh, my God, it's DJ Polaroid! Happy XOXO, ladies. To being young and pretty, and to not giving a fuck. And to Krystal. May she finally get some and stop babbling about soul mates. I can't do shots. I'll throw up. - Mmm. Come on. - No. You got it, girl. Let's go. - You got it. Uh-huh. - All right! [Girls cheering] - That's my girl. Let's go. - Let's go dance. [Music playing on stereo] Hey, give 'em that top shelf this time. I got these. That's what you party girls like, right? The good stuff? I always felt like this nothing kid from Costa Mesa, but when I was in the middle of this massive crowd, with everybody moving together and... I don't know, I felt like... You were a part of something way bigger? Yeah. And just... Just to be performing at the same event as DJ fucking Avilo, it's... - Yeah. - That's insane. I'm telling you, this is what's wrong with the scene nowadays. I remember when Avilo was this jerky kid that was literally paying club promoters so he could play shitty events in San Bernardino. And Anders, he was this weirdo, chubby Asian kid that was passing out fliers to get people to come to his shows. This shit is why I turned my back on that... - Neil? - On the whole culture. - Neil? - Yeah, hold on one second, okay? [Music playing on stereo] [laughing] Hey, are you ready to go inside? That guy's actually Avilo's manager. He said he's gonna get us inside his private room. And introduce us to Anders. Come on. We're going. - Who's Anders? - Are you serious? Anders created XOXO. No one's ever met him 'cause he's super secretive and stuff. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do you think he'll know someplace to charge my phone? I'm moving to New York tomorrow. I just got a job at a wealth management firm. - That's crazy. - Yeah. Do you have a job there, too? No, I'm in a five-year program, so I have another year of school. So you guys are doing the whole long-distance thing. We haven't really... really talked about it yet, but, I mean... Peace, love, unity, respect. That all became this vapid bro culture. Honestly, I feel sad for you guys in your fucking tank tops. - Yeah. - I feel totally sad. - Yeah. Is that-- - Sad. Actual sadness. - What, dude? - Uh-huh. Yeah. I feel sad, too. - Do you hear that sound? - [Rattling] - Sir? Excuse me. - [Neil shushes] I've been trying to talk to Montel about it, but-- [Neil] Stop talking so I can hear the sound. I think the driver might be deaf. [Indistinct chatter] Hey, thank you. Whenever you're ready. Come in. Yes, Tariq? Uh, Dad, um, you said I only had to cover Mo's shift until 3:00. [Stammers] It's 3:23. Can I please go? There's only one couple, and they're finished with their-- Tariq, I'm busy with this paperwork. I need you to work the dinner shift. The... the dinner shift? Dad, Jahar is coming in at 4:00. You have somewhere better to be? I, uh, told you Ethan's concert is tonight. I'm his manager. I have to be there. You are my manager. I'm the one who pays you. [Sighs] I just... I don't want to do this forever. [Sighs] This restaurant that I struggled to build is not good enough for you? No, Dad. No. It's not that it's not good enough. You don't appreciate the value of stability, Tariq. Of family. Ethan is my family, Dad. [Mr. Hariri sighs] His video has over one million views on YouTube. I booked him a slot at the biggest rave in America. He's gonna be a big success, Dad, and I'm gonna be there-- Tariq! This is madness. [Sighs] I give you a good job, a future, and you shit on it. I like being his manager, and I think that I'm good at it. You know, maybe it turns out that I'm not and I fail, but at least I'll know that I had tried and I... I'd hope that you would understand that. Anyways, I'm going now. Tariq. Tariq! Don't even think about it. Tariq! [Rattling] [engine sputters and hisses] - [Chad] What the fuck? - What just happened? [Jayce] Uh... [Vince] What the hell is going on? Uh, all right, listen up. All right... Listen, guys. Just relax for a little bit, okay? Uh, the bus broke down. - [Passengers] What? - Are you kidding me? [Man] What the fuck, bro? [Angry clamoring] I know, I... - I want my money back, fuckface! - [Man] We're gonna miss the fucking show! - Get up. - [Drug guy] Start it back up! - Come on. - [Ray] Shannie, where are you going? Let's just wait a second. - How're we gonna get there? - Fix it. Somebody fucking fix this shit. [Neil] I don't know what to say. [Chad] Fix it. All right, guys, let's remember the good vibes we had earlier. [Brock] Fuck the good vibes. [All yelling] What the fuck? [Neil] Don't say the f-word. - [Drug guy] I must go. - [Jayce] Stay hydrated out there. [Drug guy] Sorry. Goodbye, friend. [Neil] It'll be all right. We'll figure it out. [Girl] I want my money back. [Jayce] Put some sunscreen on. It's two, three miles, tops. We want our money back, punk. All right, uh... you guys signed the thing, and it said "no refunds," so... Yeah, it did. Also, it didn't say nothing about the bus breaking down. - Get out of the bus. - What the fuck is your game plan? - All right. - Come on, let's go! - Get off the fucking bus! - [Neil] I don't have your money on me. - [Chad] Keep fucking talking, buddy. - [Brock] Let's go. Get that little bitch out here. - All right. - [Brock] Come on. Get him out here. - Fuck! - Are you gonna give, like, what? [Tariq] Hello, you've reached Tariq Hariri Management. I'm unavailable-- Hey! You want a ride? You want some peyote? It's homegrown. - [Shannie] Come on! - [Hippie woman laughs] [Shannie] Yes! - [Shannie] Yay! - [Hippie woman exclaims] [GPS voice] Insufficient service to determine route. - Okay. - I am unable to identify - Everything is gonna be fine. - Your current location. - Everything's gonna be fine. - You are not on a road. - Everything's gonna be fine. - You are not on a road. [Camera shutter clicks] [door creaks and shuts] [indistinct bickering] [retching] Hey, what's going on in here? Um, nothing. - You waiting for someone? - Kind of. - [Sighs] - [text message sends] Are you sure he knows where to find you? - Thank you. - Be safe, but respect the journey. - [Shannie] Thank you. - Yeah, respect the journey. - [Shannie whoops] - [Ray] Here we go. [Man humming] Hi, uh, my name's Ethan Shaw. I'm performing. [Mouthing] Hey. Hey. Hey. I don't have that name on the list. Are you sure? It's Shaw, uh, S-H-A-W. I know how to spell Shaw. I'm telling you that name is not on the list. Are you sure? [Stammers] - Okay, can you just give me-- - Sir. One second? Just one second. - I need to figure this out. - Sir! [Operator] Sorry, the subscriber you're trying to reach-- [ticket taker] Sir! If you'd like to buy a ticket to get in here, the line is next to you. That line's gonna take forever. I don't have that kind of time. I have to set up. I swear. Can you-- Is there any way you could walkie someone? Isn't that what it's for? Ethan, take my ticket. I'll get a new one. - What? - [Shannie] Okay... Isn't seeing him play one of the reasons we came here in the first place? You need it more than I do. We can wait in the line. It's like 20 minutes. Come on, Shannie. It's the right thing to do. If you want to go in now, that's fine, but I'll wait out here. Fine. Yeah, you should take the ticket. - [Ray] Yeah. - Are you sure? Yeah, we'll be in right behind you. Just pay us back with an amazing set. I... I will. I promise. - [Chuckles] Hey! - Thank you so much. - Okay. Go get 'em. - See you in there! Thanks. Rock it out! Whoo! - That was nice, right? - Go get in line. [Indistinct chatter] You know, I, uh, gotta tell you... [man on radio] I am the person I believe myself to be. - [Breathing heavily] All right. - I am capable, confident and careful. Of all the clients I've managed, I gotta tell ya, Ethan Shaw is by far my favorite. - [Mutters under breath] - Doors open when I walk toward them. All right. Let's do this. [Brock] Let's go, bro. Come on. [Neil] All right. I get you guys are strong. You don't need to stretch my shirt out. That's not gonna happen. ATM machine is down here. [Chad] Right. You're upset. - What? No. - Shannie... Listen, I just want to be in there, okay? I know! We'll be there in literally seven minutes. Seven minutes? Whoo! - I want something more. - [Cell phone tweets] More what? - More... - Hey, is that for me? [Chuckles] More... mmm, swirly. - I'm sorry, did you say swirly? - [Chuckles] Yeah, swirly. All right. So wait, you, uh... you want some ice cream now? Is that it? - No. - No? No. Um, I mean, like... It's like, you go through life alone, right? And all of your experiences, choices, feelings, everything, it's... it's all your own. - Okay, but see, that's... that's freedom. - But I... [sighs] I think when you make that connection with somebody, it kind of... gets you outside yourself. And then you get to share all of those moments with somebody else. Like a perfect sunset, or a festival or a kiss. That's love. - That's all I've ever wanted. - [Chuckles] Okay. So what makes you think this guy Jordan is the one to swirl with you? [Chuckles softly] Uh... You're gonna laugh at me, so I don't wanna tell you that. [Cheering] [bouncer] Backstage pass? Hi, I'm Ethan Shaw. I'm actually performing. Backstage pass. [Sighs] Look, so I am performing. Uh, I just... Is there any way that you could get in contact with someone-- Probably not. I need time to set my stuff up, so if you could talk to somebody-- No. Not right now. Why would I be carrying all of this crap if I wasn't performing? Just so I could look cool? Man, I don't question the shit you people do. One guy out there's got a vacuum cleaner. I have no idea what he intends to clean with that thing. Give me a pass, you go through. Here, check out Ethan Shaw. Lolita stage, 7:00 p.m. It's gonna be great, all right? Dude, check out Ethan Shaw at 7:00 p.m. It's gonna be off the chart. Hey, check out Ethan-- [Mr. Hariri echoing] Tariq. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Oh, God. Okay... Oh, fuck. Shit! [Tariq] Okay. No, no, no, no, no. No! Sometimes we receive messages from the universe that are important, right? But we have a tendency to read them wrong. [Cell phone tweets] [stammers] Well, who's to say what's right or wrong? [Chuckles] I don't know. I'm just saying, you know, keep an open mind. [Cell phone tweets] Go ahead. You gotta go? I probably should just go out there, right? They're never gonna want to leave backstage. Yeah. Hey, you know, you'll find it, or it'll find you. Good luck. - [Sniffs] Krystal! - [Chopper] Whoa, wait. Stay here. Stay here. I'll grab her. Okay. [Breathing heavily] There's a $200 limit. I can't get the money out. What's your plan? How're you gonna make this right? I don't know, but there's a limit, so I can't get it out. Yeah, you said full fucking refund. I understand. What do you want me to fucking do? All right, bro. We're gonna wait 55 minutes, and then you're gonna withdraw again-- That's an arbitrary amount of time. It's not gonna-- - That's genius. - Boys, that'll work. - It's not gonna fuckin' work. - Do it again! Wait... Excuse me... Ethan Shaw. Everyone! XOXO has reached capacity. - All entrances are now closed. - What? Bro, what the fuck? [Ticket taker] Like I said, the event is now at capacity. There are no more tickets! [Indistinct chatter] [man] Hey, come on, dude! [Man 2] What the hell? Sorry, there are no more tickets. [Man] Hey, fuck you! [Angry clamoring] [cell phone tweets] [angry clamoring] I am dispensing crucial information right now. - [Cell phone ringing] - What I'm saying could save your life. - Hello? - Tariq. Jesus, where are you? It is very important that you pay attention. Ethan... it's all changed, man. Everything has changed. There was a... there was a girl. A bad girl. - What? - I'm so sorry, Ethan. [Distorted] Are you listening to me, Tariq? I'm so sorry. Tariq, I don't understand. What's going on? I can't hear-- [Krystal] Oh. Oh! - I am so sorry. - [Ethan] Oh! I'm just such an idiot. I wasn't paying attention. No, it's okay. I... I... uh... I don't know, I was on my phone and-- [chuckles softly] I was on my phone, too. [Chuckles and scoffs] Yeah, people are really into their phones these days. [Both chuckle] [angry clamoring] - [Shannie] Shit! - [Ray] What? - She just grabbed my ticket! - Your ticket? - My ticket! - Shannie! Shit! - Thank you. - Yeah. - Well, it looks like that's everything. - Yeah. - I'm Ethan-- - Nice to meet you. Um... [chuckles] I... Sorry, I... I have to go. [Crowd yelling excitedly] [Tariq chuckles] [chuckles] [grunts] Look. Stop, stop, stop. Let's just go. Turn around. No, I know. Look, you don't have to let me in. Can you get in contact with someone who knows-- You see a girl come through here? Pretty, real young looking. - Yeah. That way. - Shit. My name is Ethan Shaw, okay? Ethan Shaw? Like, the YouTube kid? Yeah. I'm Chopper. I'm Avilo's manager. [Sighs] - Coming in? - Uh... No, he ain't got a backstage pass, boss. Oh, no, he's good. He's with me. Come on. I'm so, so sorry. Should we get back on the bus? Or maybe we can hitch a ride again? There's gotta be a bunch of people that drove here that aren't getting in. Babe, talk to me. I'm trying to come up with solutions. Will you please say something, and not make me feel so guilty? I've got an idea. What? No. No. No. No, no, no. You don't even know where that goes. Well, we're not gonna give up already. I'm moving tomorrow, Ray. I'm moving far away. Don't you think you owe me since you gave your ticket away? [Sing-song] Adventure time. Shannie and Ray. - Will you look out for cops, please? - [Chuckles] It's a total emergency. They dropped Aoki's cake. I need a new one, stat. Where is the nearest Costco? Holy shit, that's Walter Robot. Uh-huh. Motherfucker owes me ten grand. You already know that area. Over here, that's the candy store. Open bar. All you can drink. All you can eat. My man's with me. Come on. [Crowd cheering] [women cheering] Okay. All right. - [Man in shark suit] Let's go! - No, thanks. - Come on, man. - Go. You wouldn't wanna miss... - Come on. - Miss Skrillex. Go ahead. [Chopper sighs] Welcome to the lion's den, kid. [Chuckles] Yo, yo! [Avilo] Sonic, this time I want you to throw the laser off the wall, and then it can kind of boom off of her buns. [Chopper] Look what I found hanging around outside. The YouTube kid we were just talking about. Hey. Welcome. Uh, Ethan, right? [Girls giggling] - Sorry. - [Avilo] That's okay. - Ethan Shaw, right? - Yeah. Nice. Avilo. [Chuckles] Hey. [Shannie groans] Ugh! - [Ray] Oh, my God. - Hello? [Water dripping and echoing] Okay, so if we went down the ladder here, we should go right to start with, right? That's... that's the direction of the gate? [Ray] Yeah... Yes. Yes, I think we go right. Okay then. Onwards. [Cell phone ringing] - [gasps softly] - [drug guy] Dude! [Ringing continues] [drug guy] Phones, man... [cell phone beeps] [breathing heavily] - Hello? - [Woman] Uh, hello. Mr. Hariri? Mr. Henderson is waiting for you by the Sedona stage. Are you on your way? - No. - What? Uh... I mean, yes. Okay. Okay, yes. Hang on. [Indistinct chatter] [Brock] Let's go! Get him! [Tariq grunts] [Mr. Henderson] But I'm not sure that, um... that YouTube hits will translate directly to record sales. [Distorted] Do you have some kind of a... a marketing strategy for how to connect those two worlds? A two month release plan, um, SoundCloud and artwork strategy. [Mr. Henderson chuckles] What the fuck? - Sales. - Get me a Coca-Cola, Patty. [Mr. Hariri distorted] Tariq! Is the answer not sales? Um, what's happening right now? I think I might be dying. [Bass drops on stereo] [crying] [sobbing] It is such a tragedy because, as we all know, Tariq had done nothing with his life. [Sighs] [music playing in headphones] It's sick back here, right? You like girls, Ethan? - [Chuckles softly] - Yeah? What do you like? Blondes? Brunettes? Asian chicks? [Ethan sighs] Ooh, you like Asians! [Chuckles] Hey, come here. Sit here. - [Chelsea] Okay. - Yeah. [Chuckles] Take your shirt off and give him a hand job. [Laughing] [laughs] [girls laughing] - [chuckles nervously] - I'm sorry. Just messing with you. [Horse whinnying] [grunts] - Uh, hi. - Your skin is so beautiful. It's like... like velvet. Like... like rose petals. Oh. Thanks. Yeah, well, you know, I better-- I'm not from here. [Chuckles] Like, from here or what do you-- [Nikki laughs] So now, whenever we roll to Amsterdam, we get treated like fucking royalty. - [Avilo] Yeah. - [Chuckles] Know what I'm saying? You can't get that kind of shit in the States. - You really can't. - You can't. - Ever been to Amsterdam, Ethan? - [Chopper chuckles] Uh, no. You ever been out of the country? Shit, you haven't left California? I visited my cousins in Michigan once. - Okay. All right. Yeah. - [Girls chuckling] - Michigan. - Dude, that is so perfect. Man, your whole life is gonna change. Change? When I said we were just talking about you, it was for a specific reason. My boy Avilo here does charity work. - Charity work? - [Avilo] Yeah. No, it's not... - It's not exactly charity. I guess. - Might as well be. Okay, I've been so unbelievably fortunate. I've had a lot of success. I like to give back to the kids who are coming up. I like to throw 'em a bone. Put 'em on my label. That's why we feature so many collaborations. Don't worry about that. It's my artist. He's dope. That's why when we heard your track, we knew you'd be a good addition to the team. Yeah. You get the exposure. We get to help a new artist. - It's a win-win. - Win-win. - [Chopper] Am I right? - [Avilo chuckles] Sure. [Stammers] I'm sorry. What are you saying? This is what Chopper's trying to say, okay? You with me? We want you to come on board, do a few tracks for us under my label. - [Chopper] Yeah. - Think about that. [Chuckles] I... I... - Yeah. - [Laughs] I wish I had my camera. Look at that face. I think I'm dead. I can't feel my face. [Squeaky] Can you feel your face now? [Moaning] - Shit. - Ooh. Shit. [Chopper] Yeah. [Music playing on stereos] [indistinct chatter] [cell phone tweets] [sighs] [Ray singing indistinctly] [Ray] At least your hair smells good. Uh... Right or left? I think we've already gone down that tunnel. Me too. [Shannie] Down both tunnels. [Sighs] We're going in circles. We're never gonna get out. [Ray sighs] This was a great idea, Shan. [Ethan] No, I honestly can't wait to show you the rest of the tracks. - [Avilo] Okay. - As soon as my manager, Tariq, gets here, - I think we-- - Whoa. No, no, no. Hold up. No. No, this deal doesn't include no managers. - Right. - If you roll with us, I'll manage you. [Scoffs] But Tariq's the whole reason why I'm even-- [Avilo] No, listen, man. Hey. I've seen more DJs than you can count come and go. I think you're talented. I really do. But it is a tough business. I want you to be a star. I want you to see Amsterdam. You know, just... Hey, think about it. If your manager's so good, how come you couldn't get backstage? I mean, where the hell's he at? [Breathing heavily] [crowd cheering] Oh, shit! [Chuckles] Oh, shit! Hi. Hey. [Crowd chanting indistinctly] - Me? - [Crowd chanting] Tariq! Tariq! Tariq! [Chanting continues] I'm coming! [Water gurgling] [laughing] [continues laughing] Oh, my God! Dude, my pocket synth. I don't have my pocket synth. - I think I left it at my house. - Where is it? We gotta turn around. - I can't play. - Is it in the trunk? No, I'm sure I left it at the house. - You didn't pack it? - No, I didn't! You can't play without the fucking pocket synth! I know I can't. We gotta go back. Seriously, we gotta turn around. - Ethan. - What? It's in your hand, man. You've been holding it the whole time. [Ethan chuckles] [chuckles] Thanks, man. I don't know what I would do without you. [Echoing] You're welcome. [Both chuckle] You'll be fine, man. [Tariq laughs] Don't you feel it? It's like... like oxygen! Like... Like our hearts and the earth are the same. Mmm. - We're like one. - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck, yeah. Oh, who's that guy? Who... What's going on there? Hey, no. You know what, uh? I... I can't... I think I'm done. Thank you, but I think I'm done. Oh, God. - Help me. Help me, please! - Oh, uh... Um, I'm so... I gotta go! No, please. Please! I just... I need water. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. [Both grunt] - Oh. - Mmm. Hey, would you mind taking a photo for us? - Yeah. Why don't-- - It'll take two seconds. You all have your phones. Why don't you live in the moment for two seconds? Don't document everything. Everyone's gonna believe you were here. - You don't need to Snapchat it. - I didn't ask for a lecture. I just asked for a picture. And I picked you because you look like you're here by yourself and not having a good time. If you wanna stay miserable, you're more than welcome to. But it might be more fun... - Yeah. - If you come and hang out with us. Come on. [Chuckles] [softly] Yeah. [Groans] [Tariq panting] He's not a bad man, you know. [Sniffles] He just wants what he thinks is best for me. Who does? [Sighs] I'm his only son. In Lebanon, that's a big deal. A son is your legacy. I see. I just... I need to prove... I need to prove myself to him, and then he'll see... He'll see I was right. [Chuckles] I'll buy him a car. Ferrari. [Laughs] No... No, it's too expensive. I'll buy him a bike. [Mr. Hariri] Tariq. [Bell rings] [laughing] Whoo-hoo! [Chuckles softly] [chuckles] Look, I don't know your dad... Achran Hariri. Or you, actually. [Scoffs] I feel like you're not gonna remember anything I say 'cause you're the poster child for D.A.R.E. right now. "Just say no." [Imitates gunshot and chuckles] [chuckles] But, um... I think part of growing up is accepting the fact that you're not always gonna get everybody's approval. It's a waste of time to try. I mean, we only get what, like, 80ish years on this planet? Eighty years. Do you wanna spend all that time worrying about what your dad thinks? I think you should meet my friend Ethan. I'm still tweaking it, but that's basically what it's gonna sound like. Bro, that was fucking sick. That shit could blow up, right? That was seriously really good. - [Ethan chuckles] Really? - Yeah. I was thinking about adding an LFO after the second drop, but-- It would be amazing if we could get that right now. You think? Do you have that USB on you? - Hell, yeah. - Yeah. Well, it's not really-- Is this kid aware that he's supposed to be on the Lolita stage in ten minutes? Ten minutes? Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm so fucked. [Music playing on stereos] So what you're saying is that I should tell my dad to close his restaurant. What? No. I'm saying that you should tell... [sighs] [men speaking indistinctly] - Come on. - He's fucked up! [Laughs] Hey, guys. Guys, come on. No, don't talk about your friend like that, okay? He's... he's beautiful and he's your friend. He's... he's our friend. He's our friend. We're friends. [Brock] Yeah. [Men laughing] - [Tariq] He's our friend. - [Chad] Yeah, buds. - I'm so happy! - Whoo! Let's go dance! [Vacuum cleaner whirring] [music playing on stereos] Holy cow! Hey, check out that old guy. Check him out! - Hey, dude. - Hey, it's the guy from the fucking bus! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Guys, what did we talk about? This man is an amazing dancer, and we have the glorious opportunity to dance with him. - [Neil] Yeah. - So, who do you wanna be, Chad? I want to be the guy who dances with him. - [Brock] What? Chad... - That's a good choice. - That's a good choice! - [Chuckling] Get in here! Get in here! - [Neil] All right. - All right. Whoa, whoa! Chill... - Come here, bro. - Okay. [Chad] Peace. [Neil] Peace. [Both] Love. Unity. Respect! [Chad] Whoo! [All cheering] [Chad] All right! [Tariq chuckles] Whoo! [Neil cheering] [Brock] Whoo! [Cheering] I used to DJ. I used to do this shit in the '90s. It's not a big deal, but-- You're telling me you were here doing this 20 years ago? Yeah. Not at this exact place, but yeah, totally. Wow, I could've been raving when I was one year old! Oh, oh, guys, guys, guys. Ethan Shaw is on the Lolita stage right now. What? That's my best friend. - Okay. - That's my best friend, Ethan! - Okay. - Come on, let's go! Come on! [Chad] Come on, let's go! [Tariq] Let's go! [Indistinct chatter] - Hey, man. - [Ethan] Hey. I've got a V1 Launchpad and an RMX. Uh, no. No, we don't have the inputs for those cables. - Uh... Okay. - You got it? Your set's getting shorter every second. Yeah, I know. [Under breath] Shit. - [Ray] We're fucked. - Stop saying that. [Music playing indistinctly] Can you hear that? We're definitely gonna get cholera, or typhoid or Lyme disease. There's rusty shit everywhere in here. I'm not going any further. Really? How do you plan to get out if you stay in the same place? Here we are, as always, stuck in the middle of some ridiculous shithole because you think you're so free. You're so adventurous, and so crazy and so fun! Well, at least I'm not scared of a tunnel. - You know what you are? - It's a tunnel! You're scared of a conversation. You were afraid of having a conversation about the fact that you are moving away and that we are going to... Shannie, where are you going? [Sound technician] All right, you ready? [Crowd chattering] [stammers] Uh, no. - Ethan Shaw, everybody! - [Feedback sounds] [music playing] [music distorts] Shit. [Distortion continues] [crowd booing] Shit. Come on, come on. He's my best friend! [Distorted music playing] - Guess who? - Who? Oh, my God! I thought we were never going to see each other. - Well, I'm super glad we did. - [Chuckles] This guy sucks. You wanna get out of here? I thought we were gonna wait for him to play "All I Ever Wanted." - Look, I made a-- - Nah. He was all hype. Come on. Let's get out of here. Okay. [Feedback humming] [indistinct chatter] [Ray] Shannie, where are you going? If you want to be in this tunnel forever, that is fine, but I am going to go out and go to the fest. Oh, fine. You go ahead. Run away! Do what you do best! If I have to spend one minute longer with you, I am going to fully freak out! - [Groans] Oh, my... - Shan. - Shannie. - Don't touch me. Well, congratulations! You got what you wanted, didn't you? Now let's just talk about it. Finish your sentence. "We're gonna..." We're gonna break up. I can do it myself. - Ethan, come on. It wasn't that bad. - What the fuck? I have been trying to get a hold of you for hours. Yeah! My bus buddy, man! Let's crush that. Sorry. Are you fucked up right now? Is that why you haven't been picking up your phone? You've been too busy partying to worry about the details, like how the fuck I get in the festival? Ethan, I didn't take anything. Honestly, I don't care what your excuse is. You knew that I was scared shitless and that I needed you. You're not just a shitty manager, Tariq. You're a shitty friend. - Ethan, man, I'm... I'm sorry. - Whatever, dude. Avilo offered me a collaboration deal. I think I'm gonna take it. It doesn't involve you. Since it doesn't seem like you give a shit about being my manager, it shouldn't bother you too much. [Scoffs] Have fun doing whatever the fuck you've been doing. [Jordan] I've been saving this for you. [Krystal sighs] Oh, my goodness! Wow! This is amazing. - Really cool, right? - Oh! So cool. [Krystal chuckles] Are you drunk? Uh, what? You seem way too sober for this party. You're gonna miss the whole experience. - Um, I mean, I had a little... - Yeah? - Come on. Follow me. - Okay. [Music playing on stereos] [blowing raspberry] Fucking cows! You say, "Throw your hands to the left," they go to the left. You say, "Go to the right," they go to the right. You know what I see when I look out there? $10, $10, $10, $10, $10... [chuckles] I'm just messing. [Sighs] Hey, don't worry about your set, man. No, that shit does not matter. I tell these people what to like. They are gonna like you. Okay? It's not romantic, I know, but it's a business. The sooner you realize that, the easier it's gonna be for you. Okay? Get those tracks to me as soon as you can. I'll get 'em in the right hands. And Chopper's gonna come by to finalize the deal. All that bullshit. [Scoffs] All right, buddy. Good talk. [Crying] I don't know how to do anything without you. I don't even know how to match my own socks on my own. How am I supposed to move to big, dumb New York on my own? [Chuckles] No, come on. It's a big adventure. Well, you're, uh... [smacks lips] you're gonna have to grow up a bit, Shan. - No more jumping in sewer tunnels. - [Chuckles] And, on my end, I need to remember that sometimes jumping in sewer tunnels is important. [Inhales sharply] No. [Grunts] Oh, this was dumb! This was dumb. But that one time we went skinny-dipping in Ash Meadows, that was... that was pretty great. You got to remember to do stuff like that. [Softly] Yep. No girls. - [Chuckles] Yeah, celibate for life. - That's right. [Chuckles softly] You are the strongest... most courageous person I have ever met. You're gonna be fine. [Stammers] Fuck that. We are going to be fine. - It'll be all right. - Okay. [Sniffles] [chuckles] Let's stay in this tunnel forever. I'm done with this fucking tunnel. Um... [chuckles nervously] So, who else have you seen play? - I saw a bunch of people. I don't know. - Mmm-hmm. - You were there when Ethan Shaw ate shit. - [Chuckles] Yeah. Actually, I... I think I met him backstage for, like, a second. [Chuckles] Well, um, I guess met isn't really the right word. 'Cause I had to run off and see you, but he seemed really nice. I didn't really recognize him at first. Um... Oh, uh... Hey, there's no rush here. You know, I just got here. Maybe we can just, um, hang out? We are hanging out. I... Yeah, but, um, I meant... I meant more like, um... talk, like, maybe we can talk. We've been talking for a month. What's left to talk about? [Stammers] I don't know. Your life? Your family? Why do you want to talk about my family? I just, um... [stammering] I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this. What? What do you want? What did you think was gonna happen? [Inaudible] Hey, is this seat taken? Man, what are you doing stuck in VIP with all these jokers? Don't you know there's a huge party going on? Look, I know this is none of my business, but that's not a deal. - What? - Fucking Avilo. That's not a deal. That's what he does. He gets a bunch of younger artists and he collaborates with them. He uses his name. He keeps all the money. Trust me, I know. I know from personal experience. You're a man, all right. Don't cry. You're a fucking man! - All right, so what do I do? - I think I can help you. [Clamoring] I feel like such an idiot. [Scoffs] I thought I could play the perfect set and everything would fall into place. - That's not what happened? - No. [Scoffs] Pretty much the opposite of that happened. Well, maybe you're not a very good DJ. - What? - I don't know, maybe you should try to do something else. Something like real estate. Who the fuck are you, dude? You show up out of nowhere like some mystery guru guy who's supposed to give me some life-affirming advice, and that's the best you got? [Scoffs] My mom wanted to be a singer more than anything in her life. But she had me when she was 18, and you know what? She gave up. - 'Cause she thought that was unrealistic. - Yeah, it is. Fuck realistic. Look, I'm a great fucking DJ. This music means everything to me. I'm not gonna let it all slip away just 'cause things aren't panning out exactly the way I expect them to. All right. I think you should go dance. What? [Chuckles softly] I think if you go out there, many things will become clear for you. That's the beauty of it, man. I created this festival because I like to dance. I mean, dancing, it's important. [Cell phone chimes] [Anders] Oh, shit. [Laughs] And so is connecting with old friends. Get out there, man. [Music playing indistinctly] [Shannie] I knew I heard something. Come on, this way. It's over here. Hey! Hey, pretty girl. You... [sniffs] You lost this, huh? How did... I... I didn't lose it. I... threw it away. We're in the center of the universe. You can't throw anything away. Like... If it's meant to find you, it finds you. I tried... I tried to throw my shoes away, but they keep coming back. [Mutters] They keep coming back. [Chuckles] Okay, well... Well, I... Not that it makes any difference, but I think this is meant for someone else. Yeah. Your soul mate? I met him. I met him earlier. Average height, uh, blondish-brownish hair. He... he was carrying too much stuff! [Laughing] I think you're confused. Don't forget to enjoy the party! You'll be home, sitting in front of the computer soon enough. [Shannie] We're gonna get out of here. [Shrieks gleefully] - No way! - Yeah! - [Shannie exclaims] - Oh! I'm going. [Shannie sing-song] Salvation! [Ray muttering] - [loud music playing] - [Ray exclaims] Come on, let's go. We're gonna miss it. [Crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] - [both] Oh, my God! - [Both chuckle] I love your song! What? I love your song! What? I still love your song! Thank you. Krystal! We have been looking all over for you! We got kicked out of VIP looking for you. Come on, we want to get a good spot for Avilo! Come on, come on. Let's go! [Girls cheering] No, man, I told you, I don't want that shit so close to my fucking face. Guess what? It's fucking hot. You want me to look sweaty? You want him to go out there and faint? Is that what you want? I can't do it. [Both] What? I really appreciate the offer. It's the most amazing opportunity I've had in my life, and maybe the most amazing one I ever will have, but I just think my priorities are a little bit-- Slow down for a second, kid. Just think about what you're doing here. I'm in this because I love it, not because I want to take shortcuts to make money. [Chuckles] It's a joke, right? - I want to work with my best friend. - Oh, Jesus! If the only deal you'll make doesn't involve him, then I'm sorry, but... - I'm gonna have to-- - Ethan, stop. Ethan, stop. Stop, dude. It's a mistake! I don't want to hold you back. If doing the deal without me is what you have to do, - that's what you gotta do. - Tariq... I am so sorry that I fucked up. This guy doesn't want to help you, he wants to use you. - Tariq. Tariq. - Ethan... Dude, I wanna be your manager, but more than that, I wanna be your best friend. Tariq! I didn't take the deal. Stop, stop, stop, stop. This Care Bear is your fucking manager? - [Chopper] Rainbow Brite, here? - You didn't? No. What the fuck is he doing here? Why is he here? He helped me get back here so I could talk to you and stop you from making this mistake. - Man, Ethan, I am so, so sorry. - Man, it's okay. [Avilo] Hey! Shut up, okay? You wanna blow this chance, fine. That's up to you. There's a million other bedroom DJs just like you. - Millions! - Yeah. Do you hear that? Wait, do you hear it? - Yeah. I own these people. - [Chopper] We own these people! I'm the king of this motherfucking kingdom, baby. - Lion's den, yo. - Yeah, that's right. Guess what? You're gonna have to enjoy a lifetime of your mom singing on your tracks - to the audience in your bedroom. - [Chopper] To your broke ass. [Avilo] 'Cause that's all you're gonna ever do. - Yeah, you're done. [Groans] - Whoa! [Avilo] Whoa, hey, security! I've wanted to do that for so long. What the fuck was that? - Faggot! Get the fuck out! - Fuck you! Get him out of here! Where the fuck were you? - Escort him out of the building. - Chopper! - Get him, motherfucker! - Try that with me. - Chill, Chopper. Easy. - [Chopper] Try that shit with me. - Chill out. Get him out. - [Avilo] Pussy! Get the fuck out of here! - Escort him out. - Let's go, bitch! - Try that shit with me. - Hey, hey. Hey, hey! Relax. - Let's get back to your trailer. - I got this. - Cool off. - Fucking faggot! Let's cool off. When did you become a homophobe? You see, we paid for this bus, right? And it broke down, and there was this riot. And we lost our tickets. We were in this sewer tunnel forever-- Everyone's stretching out my fucking shirt. Is this a festival of stretching out shirts? [Shannie] We have to get in. You don't-- That is the dick who left us on the side of the road. - Yep. - I was telling you the truth! [Stammers] Yeah, I'm sorry. Really, I am. Ow! Hey, what the fuck? You guys smell like... Are you... That's the worst smell... You guys smell fucking dead! It smells like a fucking shit... shit. Like you shit eggs. - That is nasty. - Did you shit on them? You know, thanks for everything. Did the fucking security guy shit on you? You provided the service you claimed to provide. - I mean... [scoffs] - No, actually. - I feel grateful. - Have a great life. The boss said you could come back. All right. Hold on. Wait, one second. Whoa! Don't do extra arm movements, 'cause the smell comes over, but... Uh, can you ask if I can bring my friends with me? - They're covered in shit. - I know, but just... Come with us, but stay that far away. But come with us. But let me go first. Let me walk first. Come on. What the hell are we doing? We're gonna steal the set. Go, go, go. [Ethan] Shit. Holy shit. Holy shit! Dude, what the fuck are we doing? I said we're gonna steal the set. [Crowd cheering] Dude, no, no, no. This is your moment. You gotta grab it. No. Dude, I can't. Blowing it at Lolita was bad enough. But this? No, I... I can't do it. Ethan, what did I say to you? You deserve to be here. Now, are you gonna commit to this, or chicken out and sit at home with your grandma? We came here so you could play. So now, go fucking play. I can't do it. Tariq, I can't do it. - I believe in you completely. - No, I literally can't do it. I don't have my equipment, or any of my music, or any of that shit. Tariq, you know that shit's not ready. This is the one thing that I did not lose while I got swept up in a riot, I died of a drug overdose, I went to hell, I was seduced and then attacked by aliens, and I had the spiritual experience of swimming in the bloodstream of an enormous supernatural toilet. Yes, the tracks are ready. You are ready. Please do this journey justice. I'm still mad at you. I love you! [Crowd cheering] I'm not Avilo. My name's Ethan Shaw. I hope that's okay. [Yells] Oh! Yes! - Oh, my God! That's Ethan! - [Yelling] [chuckling] [exhales heavily] Neil Berg hit me in the fucking face! I thought you said that dude was dead. It was a fucking metaphor, man! I meant that his fucking relevance was dead. All right. Chill. You good enough to play? You gotta get out there. Uh, they can fucking wait, thank you. [Scoffs] - [music playing indistinctly] - [crowd cheering] What the fuck? What the fuck is that? - Just fucking open it. - I'm trying to. - Open the fucking door, Chopper. - It's fucking locked! - Fucking locked, man! Shit! - Fucking shit! What the fuck? Hey! - Chill out, man. - You shut the fuck up! I'm calling. I'm taking care of it. - God! Fucking shit. - I'm on it. Hello? - [Avilo] What the fuck? - [Chopper] Chill out! ["All I Ever Wanted" playing on stereos] Whoo! [All screaming] [cheering intensifies] [bass drops] [Shannie laughing] Whoo! Boom! Yeah! Oh, shoot! Hey, guys! Guys, don't worry about them, all right? Stand down. I got this. [Neil] That was amazing, right? I know you at least liked that a little bit. [Chuckles] Yeah, your little buddies just hijacked Avilo's set. Someone is definitely gonna be suing my ass. Well, that's what you have fucking big lawyers for, right? Uh... I'm sorry, you know, about, like-- Not necessary, man. We're good. I've been a baby about the whole fucking thing, but it's... Well, I think it's cool that... I mean... - You know, you stuck with it. - I think it's cool, too, man. Come on, man. - Come on, man, let's get out. - Yeah. Let's go! [Music playing on stereos] [crowd cheering] - [song changes] - [crowd cheering] - [yelling indistinctly] - Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh! Neil! - I know. I know. - Oh! I fucking love you, XOXO! I love you, too. [Cheering intensifies] [crowd cheering] [drug guy] Hey, guys, come with me to the... to the festival. [Panting] X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O. Huh? Why are you filming me? [Drug guy] It's okay. [Drug guy] Yeah. I bring my own sensations to this occasion. - Whoo! - [Both cheering] Give me a hug for that, man. Give me a fucking hug for that. [Girl yelling] I fucking love you, XOXO! [Laughs] [whooping loudly] X-O-X-O! Boom!
