Even though it's this deep in the mountains, it's such a nice inn. The whole village got together and built it to welcome our guests. The whole village? For generations, they have been woodcutters. About how many people are living here in this village? Excuse me? Yes? That's why. So the ones left are only old folks like myself. Keiichi Asamiya I will leave the yukatas over here. May I serve dinner after your bath? Yes. The hot spring is very relaxing. Please clean your legs very well. We came to some place, huh? The place doesn't really matter. As long as it's far away from him. Is it really over now? Can't you let go of him cheating once? You wouldn't understand, Aiko. Understand what? It's because you've never cried over someone before.

What's going on? What happened? The room lights all of a sudden... Really... They finally... Who do you mean by "they"? Who are you? What's the meaning of this? Miss, were you able to clean your legs very well? Regarding the power outage, please don't worry. We will come by right away, so... It's okay. I'm going to bed now. I'll be sacrificed? What do you mean by that? Even if I talk to you about this, I don't know if you'll believe it... Please just tell me. I'm Akira Mononobe. I'm studying ethnology at Jounan University. Ethnology? Yeah. In ancient Japan, there was a custom to sacrifice young women to the gods in order to ward off catastrophes. In Ashikari Village too, where you are... From the beginning, Ashikari was a village of woodcutters. While the men were away chopping trees from mountain to mountain, in order to make sure the women didn't run off, the men chopped off the women's left legs. That was the start of the horrible custom. As time went on, the villagers captured traveling women and worshipped them as living gods to offer to the mountain. The women that were turned into living gods had their left legs cut off and were imprisoned in a small mountain shrine. As for that custom, it's being quietly practiced to this day. All the villagers were dragging their legs, right? When children are born, they cut the tendons in their left legs. As proof of association, but also to keep them from escaping the village. Impossible! I can understand how you don't want to believe it. But you must've seen it too. The scarecrows posted all over the village... Those aren't decorations. They mummified the women who died and worship them as guardians of the village. Be careful. The ritual has already started. We've brought you some lights. Dark places are dangerous. Please open the door, miss. What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Hello? Hello? Hello... Please tell me your name. It's Shiyori Mizuno... Shiyori... I want to help you. You can believe my story or get your leg chopped off by them. You only have one of those two choices! Hello? Hello? Mr. Mononobe! Please hold on! Is there something wrong? If you're not going to open it, I'll use my key and come in! Why aren't you answering, Aiko? It's an emergency. Contact me as soon as possible. - Shiyori Out of range Please, Aiko, answer... Please... Receiving... Crisis! I'm waiting at the restroom at the hot spring. - Aiko Akira Mononobe Mr. Mononobe? What's the situation? I managed to get out of the inn area. Did you bring the map of the village? Did you bring the map of the village? Yes... The main entrances and exits are most likely already covered. It's a little far, but there's an old tunnel towards the east end. Please wait for me there. I'm heading there with my car right now. I understand. By the way, I want to ask you something important. How did you find out about Ashikari Village? From a friend in the same club... Her name is Aiko... She invited me to go to a hot spring with her... I have to go save Aiko... How did she find out about Ashikari Village? She said she looked it up online... It's dangerous... As far as I researched, there is no information about Ashikari Village on the Web. That can't be...

Shiyori Mizuno Final Chapter: The Pair's Cell Phones at X Cross Akira Mononobe Hey, Shiyori, please listen... The one who set up our breakup was actually Aiko.
