foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Who are we? Are we simply what others want us to be? Are we destined to a fate beyond our control? Or can we evolve? Become... something more? Can you change the station? When the song's over, honey. You said that two songs ago. You know this is a classic, right? Okay, how about I make you a promise? When you're old enough to drive, you can listen to whatever music you want. Hmm? Is that a deal? John. Wasn't me. Jean, was that... Did you...? Didn't do anything. Jean, what are you...? I-I don't know. It's not me. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet! She doesn't have a scratch on her. No internal injuries. And you're sure she was in the car? Yeah. Who's gonna tell her? Thank you. Hello. Where are my parents? My name's Charles Xavier and... They're dead. Aren't they? Yes, they are. And I'm very sorry to have to tell you that. So, what happens to me now? Well, that's why I'm here, actually. You see, I have a school that is for young people who are like you. Special. "Special"'s just a nice word for... Weird? Or crazy? Yup. Yup, sometimes, it is. But sometimes, it-it can be a word used to describe people who are significant, amazing, or... just... just really cool. You've got gifts, Jean. D'you know what? Take this-this pen, right? It's something that... well, actually, just take it. It's a gift. Now, you could choose to draw a really good picture with that. Or... you could use it to poke someone's eyes out. But either way, it's- it's still just a pen. It's just a gift. And what you choose to do with your gift, well, that's entirely up to you. But if you want to use it to do good stuff, well, I can help. You're not like the other doctors. No. And you are not like the other patients. What do you think? I can't stay here. Okay. Why not? It's too nice. I... I break things. How does this sound? If you break something... anything, I can fix it. Not anything. I can help you. I can help you so that you never have to break things ever again. You think you can fix me, too? No. No, because... you are not broken. Ten, nine, eight... Seven, six, five... Four, three, two, one. Engines throttling up. Three engines now at 104% Hey, I... I'm picking something up here. Uh, ma'am, I got something on Sat six Houston, we have a problem. Space Shuttle Endeavor has encountered problems on its mission. I know what you're thinking. That's my trick. The answer is no. The jet can't get that high. Even with your new booster rockets, and all your modifications? They're built for acceleration, not elevation, okay? Not this. No. The system experienced massive failure. They've lost thrust vector control. Trajectory settings are irregular. Likely from the constant engine burn. Oxygen generation is down. Yes? Yes, this is he. Charles? Mr. President. Are you seeing this on TV? Yes, I'm watching now. Hank. Yeah. It's a simple extraction. We to into space. We get the astronauts. We bring them home. Any questions? Yeah. Like a thousand. We don't have time for a thousand. So we're going to space? Yes, Kurt, we are going into space. Doing space missions now. Cool. Will the X-Jet even get that high? Well, technically, the... It'll get us there. Let's go! Are you okay with this? I forget sometimes you can read minds. I didn't need to read your mind. It's written all over your face. You tell me it's good... it's good. If anything goes wrong, I'll turn this around in a heartbeat. I know you will. A second ship has been spotted in the sky. We have been told the President has called in the aid of the X-Men. Ladies and gentlemen of NASA, this is voice of Charles Xavier. Could someone please apprise me of the situation? We were picking up solar flares. We believe the heat shorted out their electricity. The lost control, communication, orientation, pretty much everything. Not to worry, Mission Control. Help is on the way. I think this is not as much fun as I thought it would be. That's... a solar flare? No, I've never seen a reading like this. The orientation thruster's misfiring. That cabin won't hold for long. Kurt, can you get in there? It's spinning too fast. I can't see inside the window. Scott, I need you to blast that thruster. Slow down the spin. Kurt, take Peter. Go. Storm, seal those cracks. Be right back. Oh, shit. Strap in, we're headed home. Wait, our Commander. He's not here. He was in the airlock working on the thruster. The heat signature's rising fast. I can't hold it any longer. We gotta get outta here. I said strap in! No. Raven, no. We're not leaving anyone behind. I am not putting this team in more danger. What about their team? Jean can hold that shuttle together. Can't you, Jean? You know you can do anything you set your mind to. I can hold the ship together but not from here. I need to get inside. The heat's spiking. We got less than a minute till those flares hit. She said she can do it. 30 seconds. Count it down. Go. Got 20 seconds. Ten... nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Where's Jean? Kurt, where is she? Where is she?! I'm sorry! Brace for impact! Is every... Is everybody okay? Yeah, we're okay. So let's go home. Yeah! X-Men! X-Men! X-Men! Yeah! X-Men! That's enough, boys and girls. Listen up. The X-Men have today done an incredibly brave thing. They've once again proved to humanity exactly why they need us. People like yourselves. The President sends his regards as well as his heartfelt gratitude. And as for myself, I've never been prouder. Enjoy yourselves. You certainly deserve it. In fact, you all do. No more class, the end of the day. Jean. You gave us quite a scare up there. How are you feeling? A-Actually, I... I feel fine. Hank? - Yeah? - Will you take a look at Jean? Standard medical for anyone injured in the field. You know, the President was almost sending his condolences. She should be dead. Thankfully, she's not. I basically did everything. I mean, Jean did a little, like, towards the end. But it was mostly all me. You put us in danger, Charles. You put those kids in danger. They're not kids anymore, Raven. And I care about their safety just as much as you do. Are you sure about that? 'Cause we're taking bigger and bigger risks. And for what? Please, tell me it's not your ego. Being on the cover of magazines, getting a medal from the President. You like it, don't you? As opposed to being hunted and despised. Well, you know, actually, I do. It's all just a means to an end, Raven. What end is that? Keeping us safe. You should understand better than anyone that we're only ever one bad day away from them starting to see us as the enemy again. So what, we wear matching costumes and smile at pictures - to make everyone feel safe? - That's a small price to pay for keeping the peace. By risking our people to save theirs? Yes! Yes. It's funny... I can't actually remember the last time you were the one risking something. And by the way, the women are always saving the men around here. You might wanna think about changing the name to X-Women. The heartbeat's strong, pulse is good. Brain activity's normal. The genetic reading, I'm gonna take another look at. What can't be right? Did you just read my mind without permission? Sorry, I didn't mean to, but... What can't be right? Whatever happened up there made you stronger. You know, I've never seen a power reading like this, you're... You're literally... I mean, you're off the charts. So, what does that mean? It means, um... Well, I have to build a better machine. But... h-how do you feel? I feel... good. Good. Well, as far as I can tell, you're good to go. - You can head upstairs. - All right. Thanks, Hank. Hank said that? "Off the charts"? - He did. - The big, blue, furry guy? The doctor? That Hank? That's the one. Why? Are you a little intimidated, baby? Constantly. Are you- Are you sure you're okay? I'm better than okay. God, I feel great! I do. I... I don't know, I feel like everything is... just... turned up. Yeah. No, it's just... It's what? I thought I lost you today. I know. But I came back to you. I'll always come back to you. Is that Luna? Probably just squirrels. Mmmm. I'm just gonna check on her. Be right back. Just stay. Tell her to shut up. Luna! Luna! Luna! Sshhh. Honey! Shh-shh-shh... What is it? What is it, honey? Oh, my God. Margaret? One more? After I finish this one. Two more? Yeah. - Hey. - Rocks? Thanks. How's she doing? She's, uh... Thirsty. Yeah, I see that. She seem okay to you? For someone who's just been hit with solar flares? I'd say she's doing pretty good. Thanks. You know, it wasn't so long ago we were throwing parties like this. Now we're the only ones left. Yeah. Last of the first class. I've been thinking. Maybe it's time for us to... move on. What do you... move on where? I don't know. It's just Charles... Whatever's going on between you two, it'll blow over. No, it won't. I love him, but he's different. Everything is... it's different now. Yeah. Well, we change the world so we could live in it. Yeah, but maybe that's what we should go do. This is our life, this is what we wanted. - Not like this. - Raven... It's not our life, Hank. It's his. What do you think the "X" in X-Men stands for? Charles and his X-Men are where we turn when facing our worst fears. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. All I've really done is create a world in which children can find peace and pride in being different. Now, I know that some of you choose to call us "superheroes". I must confess, I don't really know what that word means but it is a damn sight better than what you used to call us. Come, dance with me. - You wanna dance? - Come on, Scott. Did... Did you hear what the kids are calling you? - Do I wanna know? - Yeah. Phoenix. It's cool, right? You know? Bird that rises from the dead. Uh... You okay? Maybe you should take a break. Jean? Stay away from me. Stop, stop, stop, stop. It's Jean. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop! Hi. Thank you. I'm terribly sorry everyone, but I'm going to have to leave. Thank you very, very much. What is it? What do you see? Nothing. Her mutation has grown too powerful. For the first time, I can't penetrate her mind. So that's what we're doing down here? I built Cerebro to amplify my power. I think that's the only way I'm going to get inside her head now. Hank, can you turn it up please? A little more. Thank you. There she is. Is it supposed to look like this? The mind of a psychic is a fragile thing. It takes only the slightest tap to take it in the wrong direction. I had to make adjustments to her mind when she was young. What kind of adjustments? Scaffolding... walls around... to keep out all the trauma. What did you do to her, Charles? I saved her. I think that whatever happened in space did something to her. In the process, those walls that I erected are being torn down. Quiet! What is that? I know. It is what I was trying to save her from. Table for one? The usual. What is that voice? Charles? Charles? She's waking up. Jean? Jean, don't be afraid. It's only me. I want you to remain calm. And I'd like you to focus on my voice. Get out of my head. Just stay... calm. Jean... She's fighting me, Hank. Turn it up. I hurt my father. He's alive. You're just feeling things you shouldn't. Your mind, it needs rest. You... You're lying to me. I can sense it. Turn it up. It's too much already. Don't do it, Hank. - Hank! - No, I won't do it. For God's sake, Charles! Get out of my head! Charles! - Charles! - Charles! Jean! Are you... Are you okay? What happened? We were outside and then... You had an accident. You blacked out. Did I... Did I do... do that? It's fine. No, it's not fine. It was an accident. I don't know what's happening to me. I can't control it. I can't stay here, Scott. I really... I need to go. What are you talking about? - Where are you going? - I need to see... I need to see my father. Your father? Your father's... He's a-He's alive, I can hear him. He-He died in the crash, remember? I'm sorry, Scott, I need to go. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Slow down. - Scott, please let me go, please! - Just slow down, please. I can't control it. When it comes, I can't stop it. Okay? I could hurt you again. I'll take that chance. I know. I know. But I won't. - Is he gonna be all right? - I'm gonna be fine. - He's not fine. - I'm going to be fine. What did you see? She's all... desire. All rage, all pain. And it's all coming out at once. Something's happening to her, Raven. She's... changing. Into what? I don't know. Jean's gone. She left. - Gone where? - I don't know. Charles, you can track her with your mind. Not anymore. She's grown too powerful, even for me. She said she was going to see her father. That doesn't make any sense, right? Prepare the jet. We're going to bring her home. Leave? Charles, you're in no condition. Stop... she's going to find... She's going to find nothing good there. Is this all that remains of our once great D'Bari empire? Good evening, Vuk. Good evening. Did you learn their language? With ease. What have you learned? The power is being contained inside one of them. This primitive species? She's stronger. A mutant. She has no idea what's happening to her. I could use that. If we can control that power, we can resurrect our race. Begin again. Here. Where is she? Can I help you? Dad? Jean. How do you know where we're going, Charles? If you can't track here, how do you know where she is? You know how. Jesus Christ. What did you do? I protected her. From the truth? There's another word for that. He told me you were dead. I never thought I'd be back here. It's the same. All of it. Can I get you something... to drink, or-or eat? Uh, no... I'm good. I'm... I'm really good. It's so good to see you. Um, I'll-I'll get you some water, okay? Quiet. Jean? All these photos, none of me. You never looked for me. Jean. Why didn't you look for me? Maybe we should sit down. No, I won't-I don't want to sit down. Why didn't you come looking for me? And don't try to lie, I can read your mind. I can't care for her. I don't even know what she is. I do. Then you'll take her? You didn't even say goodbye. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to your mother. I was eight years old. How could you do that to me? You want to come in? Come all the way in. Don't forget what you did. It's not me. Quiet! No. I'm sorry, Jean. But my whole world died that day. And... you went with it. Jean, don't. Please. Stop that. Stop it. It's not me. It's them. You shouldn't have come here. Why is that? We've only come to bring you home, Jean. I don't have a home. You made sure of that. Look, your father couldn't handle you and we took you in. You told me my father was dead. And you used me for my powers. No, that's just not true. That's not what happened. Jean, we can help you. I can help you but you have to listen to me. No. No, I don't. Scott. You lied to me, Scott. About everything. We'll figure everything out together. Just come back to me. Remember? You said you'd always come back to me. Come back to me. Jean. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Stay away from me! - Stop her, quickly! - Charles, wait, wait! Jean, please! Jean, stop! - I got the shot, I'm taking it. - No, you're not. I'm sorry, Hank. I want Raven to have a chance. I told you to stay away. That's never gonna happen. Please. Stop. Not until I know you're gonna be okay. Something's... happening to me. So, come home. Let me take care of you. No, you can't. You can't, you don't... You don't... know what it's like. Then tell me. 'Cause when it comes... people get hurt. I'm not afraid of you, Jean. Look at me. Focus on my voice. We're going to get through this together. I'm not giving up on you, Jean. This is what family does. We take care of each other. You're my family, Jean. Can't... catch my breath. I love you. What? Raven, please. Raven, don't leave me. No. No. We are all at war. At war with ourselves. Raven had been waging that war for most of her life. I hope now, she's found peace. Raven died doing what she did best. Helping a friend. A friend in need. She is not gone. She lives on through me. Through us. And through the spirit of the X-Men. Is it true? Jean killed her? She didn't know what she was doing. Jean lost control. But she's-she's still Jean. Sh-She's still our friend. We can still help her. We can find her. We bring her home. That's-That's what we're gonna do, okay? It wasn't an accident, Scott. She killed Raven. Maybe you can't admit that to yourself, or to them. But it's the truth. That was not Jean. Not the Jean I know. Sometimes, you want to believe people are something that they are not. And then by the time you realize who they are, it's too late. D'you know, this is where I first met Raven. She was just this little girl. And she broke in, looking for food. I said she could stay and that she'd never have to go hungry again. And then I think I promised her a better life. And then you took it from her. - I beg your pardon? - You heard me. - Hank. - This is your fault, Charles. It's your fault that she's dead. Come on, that's not fair. Fair? Oh, now, talk about fair. You messed with the mind of an eight-year-old girl. You pushed out all that pain and anger. Where do you think it's gonna go? I did that to help her. What I do, I do to help her. Oh, please, come on, please! You still can't see what you did wrong? This is... No, you need to face this, Charles! You need to face it! Come on, admit it to me right now! Come on! Admit it! Charles, just admit you were wrong, please. You still can't. I really hope you feel better, Hank. I hope that raving on me five minutes after I put my foster sister in the grave is making you feel a damn... This isn't about me. You know what, I know what I did wrong, okay Charles?! She was gonna leave. Raven was gonna leave. And I talked her out of it! She saw what the rest of us didn't. And what was that? This whole time, we've been trying to protect these kids from the world, when really, we should've been protecting them from you. I don't know what's happening to me. Why? Why did I do that? No civilians past this... FBI. Give us the room. And who are you supposed to be? We're the ones who are going to help you, Mr. Grey. I didn't know she was gonna come back. I'm sorry for all this. It's okay. We just want to get an accurate picture of who Jean is. Tell us about when you gave her to the mutant. Um... Maybe, uh... It might be better if I talked to a lawyer. I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey. But I need to know everything about her now. This truly is an unfortunate development. Why-Why is that? Because it's so much easier to understand your language when you're not screaming. Who are you? What are you doing here? Answer the question. Leave her. Why are you here? Are you hurt? No. You have to forgive them. They're not accustomed to uninvited guests. Please. Why don't you start at the beginning? Whose blood is that? What? On your shirt. Whose blood is it? Look, I'm not Charles. I can't read your mind. You hurt people. - It's been a while. - But you did. Yes. What did you come here to ask me? How did you stop? I've lived with vengeance my whole life. Ever since I was a child, I... lost everyone I ever loved. So... I hurt people. Yes. Killed people. Killed whatever I thought would make the pain go away. It didn't. No matter how many souls I sent under. So I stopped. I don't know how to stop. I don't know what's happening to me. When I lose control... things happen, bad things. To people I love. Whose blood is that? Isn't that why you came here? What do you think I can do for you? - I don't know! - Yes, you do. - Whose blood is that? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Did you hurt someone? - Please! Answer the question, Jean. Stop, Erik, you're making me angry. Good! I want you to be angry. - Show me what happens, Jean. - I don't wanna hurt you! What happens when you're angry? Show me. - Show me... - Stop! We've got military. Inbound. Stay here. Two birds. U.S. Tell everyone to stay calm, but ready. Right. That's far enough. We have a legal right to be here. This land was given to us by the U.S. government. We have no intention of taking it back. We're not here for you. We're looking for one of the X-Men. Jean Grey. Haven't seen her in a long time. Then you won't mind if we look around. I don't have a home. You made sure of that. Would you mind if I came to your home, unannounced and uninvited? Look, I know who you are. - I don't want a fight. - No, you don't. Then step aside. We have the same rights as you and your family. And like I said, we're not here for you. We're here for a girl who gave up those rights when she attacked a squad of police officers. They have families, too. Guess you didn't hear about that. We don't get the news out here, Captain. Stop that. I said, stop that right now! It's not me. It's me. Jean? Jean! Get down! Get in the chopper and go! I can't hold it! Fall back! Fall back! Move, move, move! That's okay, move it! Come on! Come on! Go! Leave this place! I need your help. I thought you protected mutants here? I am protecting them. From you. You need to leave. Go! We're coming late tonight that Congress is considering temporary mutant internment facilities for those whose powers have been deemed a clear and present danger to human citizens. This, coming on the heels of the Jean Grey incidents, which, after destroying two communities, and attacking police and military personnel... This is Charles Xavier, I need to talk to the President. Mr. Xavier, this phone will no longer be operational. I... have to tell him not to do this. There's no need to throw away everything that we've accomplished. You have to give us a chance... If you break something... anything, I can fix it. Not anything. An international search is underway for Grey. Authorities are urging citizens to keep their distance Any sighting should be reported to the police immediately. Government officials have... This man was elect... Is that all ya got? Give me another. Hello, Jean. You can't control my mind like theirs. I'm not like them. Same, please. How did you find me? Let's just say, I have friends in high places. Who are you? The better question is, who are you? Are you a scared little girl who answers to a man in a chair? Or are you the most powerful creature on the planet? I don't know who I am. Yes, you do. You're the girl who everyone abandons. Maybe they had good reason. Because of what's inside you? You're afraid of it because it makes you bad. Evil. All the words you've been taught to keep you in line. Words created a very long time ago by men with very little minds. They can't begin to comprehend what you are. Even your X-Men. You can? Charles. Charles. Charles. Hey, Hank's not in class. Uh, what? Hank's not in class. Did you check his quarters? Yeah, he's not there, either. Where are the rest of them? No, I'm alone. What, no Charles? If you're looking for Jean, she's gone. No, I know that. Well, why are you here, Hank? You have eyes and ears around the world to help you find mutants for this place. I want you to help me find Jean. I have no reason to find her. Not for me. Do it for Raven. She send you? You don't know? Know what, Hank? Raven's dead. Jean killed her. I need you to help me find Jean. If I find her, I'll kill her. I know. They know who I am? Yes. And they're not afraid of me? The only person here afraid of your power... is you. This is what you wanted to show me? No. This is what I want to show you. What entered you in space was not a solar flare. And it was not an accident. It was drawn... to you. What was it? A pure and unimaginably powerful cosmic force. We saw it enter you in space. We were there, Jean. Following that force. Why? Because it's the spark that gave life to the universe. And the flame that consumed my world. What remains of my people searched the stars for that power to control it. But it destroyed everything it ever came into contact with. Until you. Why me? Because you're stronger than you know. Because you're special, Jean. With my help, you could control what's inside you. Harness that power to create whole new worlds. Turn dust into water. Water into life. It's your destiny, Jean. To become something greater. To evolve into the greatest force in the galaxy. I told you they could never understand you. And what they don't understand, they fear. And what they fear... They seek to destroy. Did Raven suffer? Not for long. I know we've had our... differences in the past, but... We both love Raven. Yes. Yes, we did. There's been a sighting of the girl. Where? New York. We'll have eyes on the ground when we get there. It's time. We know where Jean is. I thought you said you couldn't track her. It wasn't me who found her. It was Erik. Hank's with him. They're on their way to her. And they're gonna kill her. And anyone who stands in their way. Kurt, I'd like you to take Scott and I there, but that's all. I want you to leave us there, then come home. And me? I'm not talking to you now as X-Men. Scott and I will go and fight for Jean without you. End of discussion. Storm, I have lost so many of the people I love. I'm not going to ask you to go. Oh, yeah. We need you. I need you. I've got your back. - Look. - End of discussion. Kurt, close your eyes. I'll show you our destination. Where are they? She's in there. Hello, old friend. Save the "old friend" shit, Charles. And stay out of my way. I'm sorry for what she did. But I can't let you go in there. You're always sorry, Charles. And there's always a speech. But nobody cares anymore. We do this here, now, they'll see us as monsters. Violent freaks fighting on the streets of New York. What did I tell you? Damn it, man, your homeland will be gone! Everything you care about. Save it. If you touch her, I will freaking kill you. Don't do this, Erik. Killing Jean will not bring Raven back. The girl dies. Kurt, I need you! Kurt, get me inside. You're not the only one who can control minds. Kurt! They're coming to kill you. You're not gonna let them. You're gonna fight back. Feel the power inside you. That power is you. Hold them! I know whose blood that was. You cast me out. Now you come here to kill me? That's right. And you couldn't even do that. Let me show you how. Scott, a little help. Kurt! Kurt, Kurt! You all right? No! Come here! Get me in that house, now! You've come to kill me, too? Never. Jean, never! I failed you, I know that, but... this isn't you. Jean, please! You have no idea who I am. I've raised you since you were a little girl, I think I do. She's not your little girl anymore. What are you? Jean, please, try and remember what I told you. You can control it. You can do anything you set your mind to. So, show me. Walk to me. You know I can't. No... Please, Jean. Please! I can't see your mind anymore. Do you see mine? Look. Jean, look. What you choose to do with your gift, well, that's entirely up to you. This could be your new home. We could be your new family. No! Because you are not broken. Will you take her? Yes. I can help her in ways that you can't. She can't be helped. She's a lost cause. No, she's not. As long as there's someone who cares for her who believes, then there's still hope. There's still hope. I knew... I knew you were still in there. He just showed you your past. Follow me into your future. No. Set weapons to neutralize. I never asked for this. Any of it. I traveled the stars for a gift that you don't want? Then take it. Please. Free me. I'll try. Stop it, you're going to kill her! Your lives mean nothing. Your world will be ours. You'll kill us all. Yes. Jean, you have to let go. Jean, let go! Let go, Jean, let go! Let go! There's one! Get him! Jean! Jean. Jean? Jean, Jean? - Charles, what's wrong? - I don't know. I can't read her mind. Come on, out! Take him out! Come on, out, out! Get it, come on. Go, move, move, move! She's alive. Scott, you have to get her out of here. We're clear! Last one. Okay, clear, clear. Get back, let's go! My kid used to be a fan. Raven had the right of it. Jean was never the villain. I was. I should never have lied to her. I was wrong. But... this power inside of her, I never put that there. I would never do anything intentionally to hurt her. That isn't me. And this... is not Jean. We can still save her. She's still Jean inside. We're 10 mile out from Mutant Containment Center. Prepare for prisoner transfer. What exactly is controlling her? I don't know. But this woman, this... thing has had a taste of that power and she'll be coming back for more. She'll be coming back for Jean. Good. Let her. She'll kill her to get it. And I promise you, the killing will not end there. That's not what Raven would've wanted. You know that. You both do. Cooper, are you seeing this? Alpha One, you have multiple hostiles on board. They're heading towards the back. - Open four to five. - Copy that. All right, you two, come with me. The rest of you, stay here, guard the prisoners! Don't be fools! You need our help. Lock it down, now! Goddamn muties come to spring ya. They're not mutants. Free us. You're going to need our help. We're the only chance you have. Keep your mouth shut. Mayday mayday may... What's the status on those mutants? We're falling back now. They're not... - What? - They're... - They're not what? - They're not mu... They're here for Jean. Get ready to open fire. Y-Y-Your kid was right about us. We could help you! Please! There's more! We only want the girl. Step aside. No! What are you doing? What Raven would have. Scott, get me to Jean! Selene! Hank! Help Storm! No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, please. Don't die! Scott, guard the entrance. Jean, wake up! Jean, wake up, you have to wake up. Hank! I have no desire to fight you. I get that a lot. You wanted her dead. I had a change of heart. I was trying to protect you. I was trying to keep the pain away. But... You just buried it. Jean. Where...? Are we inside my mind? It's more peaceful than mine. I'm so sorry for what I did to you. I know. All I ever wanted was to protect you and give you what you deserve. What every child deserves. A family. Yes. I know you did what you did out of love. I forgive you. I know what I need to do now. What is that? Protect my family. Jean, wait. You want this power? You're gonna get it. Jean! You can't control it. If you kill me, you'll kill... them all. Your emotions make you weak. Jean! No. Jean! You're wrong. My emotions make me strong. She's gone. She... She is free. I know who I am now. I am not simply what others want me to be. I am not destined to a fate I can't control. I evolved beyond this world. This is not the end of me. Or the X-Men. It's a new beginning. Hey! Slow down. Safety first. Is that all, monsieur? Oui, merci. How's your time treating you? What are you doing here, Erik? Came to see an old friend. Fancy a game? Not today, thank you. A long time ago, you saved my life. And you offered me a home. I'd like to do the same for you. Just one game. For old times' sake. I'll go easy on you. No, you won't. subs by enwansix
