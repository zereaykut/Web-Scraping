Come on, Katie! - Mum, wait! - Come back soon. Tony! Tony! Come on! Katie! Katie! Go on, Katie! - Come on! Come on! Come on! - Really high! - Come on. - Wow! Dad! Dad! What's happening? I don't know. - Dad! - Tony! - Dad! - Tony! Get back! Get back, Tony! Dad! Daddy! Tony! Agh! Daddy! Dad! Daddy? Tony, what's happened? Did you have a bad dream? Tell me about it. Daddy was looking at me. Darling, it was only a dream. Come on. But he was taken away. He left us. Now, you know that. He'll come back. He still loves us. Of course he loves us. Go to sleep. Good night, darling. What's wrong? Don't worry, Analise, it's the same thing. Shall I talk to him? I don't understand this nightmare. I thought he'd got over all that. He needs a father. But you're here. He doesn't like me. - That's not true. - It is true. He's obsessed with Sam. "Daddy did this." "Daddy could do it better." It's been three years. How can he remember all that stuff? He likes you. Does he? Of course. He doesn't feel that you're his father yet. You just need more time together. What is it? Can you see anything? Stay in the car. Get back in the car! Ben? Ben? - We continue our late-night concert... - Ben? With Sviatoslav Ashkenazy's interpretation... of Debussy's 29th Prelude... Ben? Leave it! Come on, let's go. Mummy! - Mummy! - Tony? - Mum. - Hi, Tony. It's all right, sweetheart. You've had a bad dream. Let's go back to bed. What is it? What's the matter? Hm? Hungry? Din-dins? There. Who is it? Who is there? Who's there? Divine! Come back! What do you think you're doing? Divine! Divine! Where are you? Come back! Divine! Come on! Be quiet! Feeling better? Are you angry with me? What's wrong? Is it Joe? - Daddy's hurt. - What? Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Joe! Don't be frightened, Mum. Where does it hurt? I won't be cross. Don't worry, Mum. Joe! What's the matter? Call a doctor. - Christ! What's he done? - Quickly! Analise! Get Analise! Hurt? - No pain at all? - No. Then where did that blood come from? - I don't know. - From you? Daddy sent it. How did he send it? Dunno. Just felt something sticky. I think it's time you got some sleep. Into bed then. Thanks, doctor. Is that all? - Goodnight, Tony. - Goodnight. Snuggle right down, sweetheart. Night night. Sleep well, love. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? He appears to be perfectly healthy. If he'd lost that much blood, he'd be too weak to tell us anything. He hasn't told us anything anyways. I'll test his sample, of course, but I'm quite certain it's not Tony's blood. Well, if it's not Tony's blood, whose is it? You're saying he's pulled some grotesque prank? Why? Could your husband possibly have been in contact with Tony? - Without your knowing it? - No. I think you're making a big thing out of it. He's a resourceful kid. He has a big imagination. He doesn't need Sam to help him come up with a trick like that. Joe, just say out of this, please, will you? I think we can all agree that Tony has had a rather traumatic experience. And he does still seem to insist that his father disappeared in this bizarre manner. Yeah. He won't accept that his father ran out on him so he has him disappear in a flash of light. Psychology 101. Mrs Phillips, may I suggest that Tony might benefit from some professional help in this area? Listen to me. Tony simply misses his father. He doesn't need thousands of expensive psychiatrists, only a little time and care. Hold on, Analise. Just let him finish. It's just a suggestion. I'll ring you tomorrow and if you'd like me to arrange something for you, you can let me know then. Good night, Mrs Phillips. Goodnight, Miss... Mercier. Miss Mercier. Come on, he's doing his best. Yeah. Stupid doctors. All a doctor can think of is another doctor. Oh, come on, poor thing. You need a rest. It isn't Tony. It's Sam. What do you mean? I mean all this nightmare business. It reminds you of Sam. And what about Joe? Oh, I don't know. I don't want to think about it. OK. Good night. Sleep well. Night, Analise. Thanks. See you in the morning. Hello? What? Ra... ch... el... Who? Er... Look, Mummy. Mummy, watch. Marvellous, darling. Finish your breakfast. Finished a one-mile hike. Analise? Analise? Mum, his trousers keep falling down. Oh dear, darling. - Joe, get Analise. - OK. Come on, Analise, let's go. Tired. What time is it? Tony time. Is he going to school? Yup. - What about last night? - Forget it! Is she awake? I don't know. With her it's hard to tell. Morning, Tony. How are you doing? I'm OK. Listen, I'm going to be doing some pictures of old aeroplanes today. Why don't you come along? Maybe even get you a ride in one of them? - Maybe. - Ah, come on, you'll love it. Don't really know. Tony! I don't want Harry in the kitchen. Put him back in his tank. Don't worry, Harry. Daddy likes you. I like Harry too, but not in the kitchen. And he's not going to school. Oh, Mum! I'm doing those shoes today with Paula. Can you come and look after the lab work? I'm picking up Tony. What about Analise? She's got other plans. Oh, I see. She's got other plans. What did Tony say about last night? I didn't ask him. I'm not going to push it. Hey, Tony! School time! Come on, Tony! Morning! Hello! And how's my little Tony? - I could eat you up. - Tony, come on. - Getting so tall! - Eugh! Work hard at your lessons, young man. Diligence pays. Tony! Sorry about that. Are you all right? Shit! Oh, leave it! - I've got to go. - They'll ring back. - I can't. - It's not important. No. Hello? Rachel. You're not busy? Well, do we need any food? Mm-hm. How much? Yeah, yeah. What size? Well, what about liver? - Are you all right? - No, no, it's OK. I... I just had a pain. In my leg. No, it's OK. - Look, I'll pick Tony up. - Yeah. I'll see you about five. See you. How long have we got? Long enough. OK, Paula, could you stop eating? We don't want to see the crumbs on your toenails. Kev, can you just get rid of that stuff? That's good. And dust off the shoes. That's it. - Nearly there, Joe. - OK. Now... Hang on. Can you remove the food, Kevin? Take it away. Oh! I haven't finished yet. I don't want to see your fat foot here. Thank you very much. Paula, you're not selling an orthopaedic shoe. OK, Paula. Could you just arch the foot a bit? Think of that foot as your face, and smile. Cheese! Bloody cheese! Paula, let's stop messing around now and just look beautiful. - Kev, give me back my sandwich. - That's it. Have you rounded up those dupe negs yet? They'll be at the lab at four. - I'm off to get Tony. - OK, I'll see you later. Listen, we'll have to do one more for Lloyd so just keep the novocaine on the foot, OK? I'm going to take him to the zoo. See if he'll talk to me. Mm, it's a good idea. Paula, please stop drooling. Hello? Where's Tony? Has he been kept in? No. His father picked him up. That's impossible. A few minutes ago. You just missed them. It can't have been Tony. I saw them leave myself. Which way did they go? Tony! Tony? Hi, Mum. Sam! Hello, Rachel. Mum! Your mum's upset. You bet I'm upset. Good to see you, Rachel. Looking well. What are you doing here? - I'm back. - You're back? Back from where? I'm not sure. You're not sure? You disappear for three years without a word. I don't know where I've been. I can't remember a thing until today. - I saw Tony in the street so I... - You want to come home. Like it was. That's it, isn't it? I knew you'd come back. They didn't believe me. Who's they? Three years, Sam. Three years. You wait here, Daddy. You'd better clean yourself up. There's a razor in the bathroom. I'll get you something else to wear. Do you want a drink? Still Scotch? Please. Dad! Say hello to Harry. Hello, Harry. Whoa! He's beautiful. Daddy, are you going to stay with us? Are you back for good? Yeah. He picked up Tony from school. Oh, yes, I'm serious. He doesn't know. He's lost his memory. Mum said you can wear these. Harry's laid four eggs. How long before they hatch? Well, wait and see. Eugh! That's Joe's. How should I know? Joe... Joe, please just get over here. Who was that girl with you this morning? Analise. She lives here. What does she do? She helps Mum. She's French. Better? Do you recognise this? Yes. I think I do. Sam, what's the last thing that you remember? The cottage. We were at the cottage. I was with Tony. You'd gone away. - Then it started. - What did? First this light, this brilliant light above me. I could see Tony was scared. He... He kept yelling but I... I couldn't hear him. It was as if I was held in that light. And a wind, a strong wind. It was hot. Felt good. Sounds like one of Tony's stories. Was it you on the phone this morning? No. Joe will be back in a minute. Hello there, Miss Goodman. Ooh, good evening, Mr Daniels. I see you're walking up the stairs again. Yes, it helps me get to my apartment. Oh, so it's your apartment. I see Mr Phillips is back. I'll miss our little talks. Come on, Dad. - Rachel? - In here, Joe. - Hi. - Hi. - Sh-sh! - That one. Oh, Daddy! Well, Sam, how long have you been back? Um... Just today. Where are you staying? He hasn't arranged anything yet. Tony, time for your bath. - I want to stay with Daddy. - Tony... You going to be around for a while? Oh, for the time being. What are your plans? - Analise, Daddy's back. - I don't know. I haven't got any work lined up, if that's what you mean. Mm, things are pretty tight. Won't be easy. I hear you're busy. I've been lucky. You know me, Sam. Look British, think Yiddish. Joe, would you like a drink? Yeah, that'd be nice. - Sam? - Um, no thanks. Analise, keep an eye on Tony, will you? OK, OK! So you've been... taking care of things, have you? Yeah. Look, Sam, what do you want? I want to be home. This isn't your home any more. That should be obvious. I'm just bringing these in. I can't handle this. Look, I don't know what to say to the guy. He thinks he's going to move back in. Well, give him time. Time! He has had three years! He has got to go. Where could he go? This is the only place he's got. Rachel, he walked out on you. I don't know that he did. I see. He can't remember anything. That is garbage, Rachel. He tried something new. He ran away on his family and it didn't work out so he comes back. What else do you expect him to say? You don't know him. I married him and I lived with him. And now you live with me. I just don't trust him. Tony. Tony! Tony, supper time. Come on. Hurry up, darling. Tony, where are you? Tony? Tony? Joe, have you seen Tony? Isn't he with Sam? Joe, he's taken him. Tony? Don't hide from me. What's the matter? You were eating Harry's eggs. I needed them. What for? I'm not the same as before. Do you remember when they took me? Yes. I went to another world. I had to be changed so I could live there. Why did they take you? I was lucky. It could have been anyone. Why did you come back? I came back for you. - And Mum. - Of course. Do you want to come with me? Don't be afraid. I'm your dad. Going to catch your death of cold, you are. Joe, we'd better call the police. We should never have left him alone with Tony. That's what he came back for. Come on, Dad, it's my turn. Come on, Dad! Where have you been? We went to buy some sweets. Well... Would you mind letting me know where you're going next time? Of course. You haven't done that properly. No, I haven't stuck... Oh, another one! And now news of fresh disasters. I'm speaking from the car park where only hours ago the hideously mutilated body of a young woman was discovered. One senior police officer said, "This is an act of the most monstrous brutality." - You look different from your picture. - Really? Mm, you look much younger. Don't you think so, Rachel? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. A change is as good as a rest, right, Sam? Gets you back in shape. It is odd you arrived at this moment. You know Tony's been dreaming about you. I'm glad he hasn't forgotten about me. Did he tell you what happened last night? Yes. He's missed me. - You two get along? - Oh, very well. He wants you to stay, you know. How long will you be here? - It's not up to me. - Not long. - It's not up to you either. - Please. - As a matter of fact, it is up to me. - Joe! Because Rachel's divorcing you. - Joe, not now. - But why not now? Everyone's here. Right. So I have a little announcement I'd like to make. Rachel and I are going to get married. - Oh, great! - Thank you. I'm so happy for you. Sam! You crazy maniac. You're out of your fucking mind! Daddy! Daddy? You didn't have to dump that on him. He should be in a hospital. What is it, son? It started on its own. I didn't mean to. I was just thinking about the noise it made. That's all it takes. If you think hard about something... ...you can make it happen. But I couldn't stop it. - I tried. - Look... You'll be able to do lots of things. Don't be frightened. Use it when you need it. What for? Well, you'll know when the time comes. You'll feel it. Like when you were hurt by that car? I knew what was happening. Remember, it's our secret. We're a team, right? Right. Do you like Analise? Perfect. It's just what we need. But... you mustn't damage her, OK? I think this belongs to your son. Oh, God! Harry! It appeared in my supper. How did it get there? I'm not interested. Clearly your son is not responsible enough to look after animals. Anyway, it's ridiculous keeping a snake as a pet. I'm sorry. She's just a stupid woman. Tony... No. Tony... Look at me. Later. - Night. - Bonne nuit. I've hunted out some more of your own clothes. You didn't throw them out. Good night. What are you going to do? Look, he can't stay here. You know that. Oh, don't push me. Letting him stay isn't going to help, and it won't do Tony any good either. Hello? When he left I knew exactly what I'd say to him if he came back. And what I felt. And now I don't know. If that's how you feel, what the hell am I doing here? Darling, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. That's Miss Goodman. She killed Harry. Quick! It's Mum! If I hear another squeak out of you tonight, I'll be very angry. - Do you understand? - Yes, Mum. That's her again. I hate her. All right, I'm coming! Oh! What do you want? Morning, parrot. Have some breakfast. Here. Come on, speak to me, parrot, huh? Why don't you speak to me? Do you remember when that was taken? I'd just painted the bedroom ceiling. You can see the paint in my hair, look. I can't remember who took it. I did. On the timer. Oh yes, you balanced it in the tree. God, it was so hot that summer. - Telephone! - Coming. - Is it Joe? - No, it's a doctor. Oh. Hello? Oh. Well, that's a relief. No pain at all? No, no, he's been OK today. Um... However, he might be able to talk to someone more... Thanks. Yes, thank you for phoning. Analise, could you take the stuff that's ready to the cleaner's? That way we'll get some of it back by this afternoon. Don't you want me to take this? No, I haven't finished with it yet. And I'll finish the stuff in the bedroom too. OK. See you later. Come on, Tony. Let's go. - Who's this? - OK, I'm coming. - And turn that off. We're going now. - OK, I'm coming. I don't know. It was in your jacket. Well, I've never seen her before. Oh, come on! You must know who it is. She's probably worried about you. And this? I mean... What day was this? Whose boat? Well, maybe it isn't my jacket. Or your money? Hi. I didn't think you'd be working today. Just checking some stuff. How are they? They'll do. Do you want some wine? No, I'm driving. We're going to the cottage. Who? Well, me and Sam. I thought it would help if I took him there. Mm-hm. It's the last thing he remembers. It hasn't been easy for me either, you know. I found this in his pocket. Lousy shot. Look on the other side. He doesn't know anything about it. Fine. - I'm leaving Tony with Analise. - Good. Can't you feel any sympathy? No. Joe, is this OK? - Let's take a look. - Hello, Rachel. Don't you like it? I think the blue one's better, Paula. Oh, I think it's really nice. I thought you'd given up doing that sort of stuff. I've changed my mind. Sam's waiting. Bye. Sorry, Sam. I want to play hide and seek. You're too old to play hide and seek. I want to. Well, you can't do it here. There's nowhere to hide. Go into my room. I'll be there in a minute. Tony, will you be OK playing on your own? I've got to lie down for a while. You're always lying down. What is it, Tony? Can we play hide and seek now? I got a little headache. Later on perhaps. I think we should play now. - Can I come in? - Wait a minute. We'll have a quick game. Just a quick game, OK? Big deal! Stay in here. I won't be long. 17, 18, 19, 20. OK, here I come. I'm going to catch you, Tony. Tony! Analise! That's enough, Tony. Going up now. Analise! Come and get me! Oh, it's good to be back here, isn't it? Sam? Someone's been here. Gas? Open some windows. How long's this been on? Ugh! Nothing's missing. Shall we report it? Let's go for a walk. I want to see some more before it gets dark. OK. Ana? Analise? Tony? Analise? Agh! I love this place. I wonder if Tony's treehouse is still here. He never came here, you know, after you left. I think it was over here, wasn't it? Ugh! Sam? Sam! Someone's been here as well. Sam. What is it? You're shivering. Is it something you remember? You're so cold. I missed you. Do you want some more wine? Yeah. Thanks. We used to have some good times here, didn't we? I mean... This was more home than London. - Do you come here with Joe? - Yes. You're not too sure about him, are you? - Well, it's just... - You're not. Are you? It's not like that any more, Sam. I'm going to phone home. See how they're getting on. Hello? Hello? Tony? Hello? Mr Knight? It's Mrs Phillips here from number six. I wonder if you could go and check out my apartment for me. Tony and Analise are there on their own and I can't get through. Delighted to help. You leave it to me, Mrs Phillips. No problem. Thanks. It'll be a pleasure. Bye. Bitch! Ugh! Cheap foreign bulbs. Nothing works properly in this effing country. Who's there? Tony? Is that you, boy? Stop messing about. One of your practical jokes, I suppose. - Hello. - Joe? - Rachel. - Sorry to disturb you. - How are you? - I'm worried about Tony. - Have you tried calling? - No, I can't get through. I called Mr Knight to check things out. He hasn't called me back. Yeah, look, would it help if I went to see if Tony's OK? Would you? - Sure, I'll go. - Thanks. - Just see that everything's OK. - Mm-hm. - I'm a bit worried about them. - Mm-hm. OK, I'll call you from the apartment. OK. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Oh no! What are you doing here? Analise dropped me off. Why? She went out with Michael. You mean she just left you alone? Never mind. Just get in the car, OK? Come on. Where are we going? We're going to the cottage to see your mum. Great! Darling... Darling. You've hurt yourself. Your face! No! Don't go. Rachel... I'm sorry. Are you...? Are you hurt? Stay here. Why? Just do it. Don't open any of the doors, OK? Lock it. Rachel. Rachel? Where's Tony? He's in the car. You've got to get into the car and drive away from here. Christ! Come on. - He's gone! - Look! What is that? Oh! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
