foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I see a dream. I see the future inside my dreams. The two holy swords. It is also said that two "Kamuis" appeared. I'm Kakyou. An earth dragon, one of the seven angels. A seer, who sees the future in dreams. Where am I from? Why am I able to see the future? And what meaning does this have? Everything means nothing to me now. Everything has already been lost. At that time.. With the person I loved so much. Right there.. Please let me do this. Hokuto.. You shouldn't have come here.. If you come here.. You will be.. .. Dead! You cannot.. Don't come here.. What I saw in my dream.. Will come true. Hokuto.. Run.. Kakyou.. Why.. Why? Hokuto.. Madam.. It's over. He is dead? I believe it's just a matter of time. I understand. Do what you can for him. Yes. That boy.. He was born with the power to see the future in his dreams. This was his painful fate. Everything is over. Ended. Huh? Where am I? This is not my dream.. This means.. That this is your dream? Correct. This is my dream. Why was I able to enter your dream? Why? Because I wanted to see someone. Because I was alone all this time. I would like to see.. Someone. See someone? So would anyone be fine? You can't be saying that.. With a beautiful girl like me in front of you! Who are you? A prophet, perhaps? That's what I thought. I heard.. That there are people who can see the future in their dreams. Are you surprised that I know? I grew up in a family of paranormals. Ever heard of the Sumeragi clan? My little brother is the leader now. I don't know how to use most spells. Talentless, I think. But, having little power, I got to know him this way. My name is Hokuto Sumeragi. What is yours? Kakyou. Kakyou Kuzuki. Kakyou, huh? So why are you alone all the time? Didn't you leave there too? Is that why you wanted it yourself? It's not? So it's easy! I will take you somewhere. Where would you like to go? To anywhere. This is not worth it! Because it's our first date! I would like to see the sea. The sea? How about a sea like this? This is inside my dream. But the sea in real life is much more beautiful than this one! Since we know each other so well, I want to see you. Not in our dreams, but the real Kakyou. I want to see you too. But.. But? I cannot go out. Never. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go. Now let's go out! Even though I see the future where you die, I couldn't do anything. Not even to protect someone special to me. That was the moment my heart died. I won't do anything else. I can't feel anything. And.. Just sleep.. I will continue to see the future in my dreams. The dream of the tragedy that will happen in the future. I just watch it. The time of a new tragedy is approaching. Guided by destiny.. The dragons of the sky, the seven seals.. .. And the dragons of the earth, the seven angels, will gather. And the one who holds the key to the fate of the world.. Kamui. With the arrival of this boy, everything would start to move.. Towards a single future. The future is always.. one. No one can change this. All I can do is know the future through my dreams. I can't even save a soul, of so many that will be lost.. In the final battle. Everyone's fate has already been determined. Even if they find.. And hurt.. And love each other. I promised you.. That if anything happened to you, I would protect you. And this will not change either. Never. I had forgotten. You should forget about that too. And never do things you wouldn't do. This is our new promise. Kamui.. I choose you, girl. He chose? If I'm going to choose, I'd rather it be someone beautiful. Choose? What did you choose? The person for whom I will give my life! Am I interfering with your fun? No, I'm done. So tell me, Satsuki. That boy is the real "Kamui"? Beast replied yes. I understand. So it has finally started. I'm sure "Kamui" won't bother you. Do you smoke cigarettes? It's not good for your health. I've been looking for you all this time. Why? To make my wish a reality. You are one of the sky dragons, trying to save the earth from destruction. I have no interest in the future of the earth. Your wish.. is to kill me? I'm the one who killed your dear sister. You really are adorable, Subaru-kun. It's a good dog. A strange dog, but a good dog. And.. Hey.. Is.. something wrong, young lady? Did I do something bad? This is the first time I know someone who can see my Inuki. Answer me. Why can't we kill humans? Why are humans stronger than other creatures? It's not that! If a creature is stronger, is it okay to kill humans? It's not that. I will ask you one more time. Why can't we kill humans? Answer me. Inuki! It's a difficult question. Poor thing. That sky dragon.. I was going to cry because I didn't have an answer. An answer based on the ethical point of view. An idealistic answer. A biological response. There are many things that can serve as an answer. But none of them are a complete answer. What do you think, Yuto? Well, I think that's probably because.. People would be sad. Nataku, what is your wish? I don't know. But I don't think I'd like to part with you. Why? Because you look like.. my father. What did your father name you? Kazuki. There is no such thing as an emotionless creature. You just think you don't have them. I'm the one who should go. You have a wife and a lovely daughter. Kamui and the other seven seals are still young. But I.. Aoki-san! Do you think no one would cry for you if you died? I would cry. So there really were two "Kamuis". An accompanying star born to fill the empty place.. Whichever side, heaven or earth, the true Kamui will choose. Kamui chose to be a sky dragon, one of the seven seals. So the other "Kamui" is mine. It's not that.. The "Kamui" which is an earth dragon.. .. One of the seven angels, is already nearby. It's not that, Kanoe! Sister, I will prove to you that your premonition was correct. Kanoe! Don't invite "Kamui" inside! The earth calls for a revolution. A revolution that humans will not disturb. To do this, we will liquidate everyone who pollutes the earth. Mano.. The tragedy had repeated itself in dreams. This is destiny. Everyone just goes with the flow. There is only one future. One. Is that what you wanted? Yes. Because you had the potential to become a prophet, I could cross into your dreams. We have dreams even at the moment of our deaths. I knew this would happen. But, Even though I know the future, I can't do anything about it. The person who was so dear to me.. Is you.. I couldn't save any of you. Thank you, Kakyou. I have to go now. Kakyou.. If you see my brother and Kamui-chan, please tell them.. That I love them both. And.. That the future has not yet been decided. That the future has not yet been decided.. No. It has already been determined.. The moment I became an earth dragon. You should know that, if you're a prophet. There is only one future. Kakyou. Come with me. And weave dreams for me. For now, I still see the future in my dreams, Even though I know I can't do anything about it. Even so, I still hope.. That the words that girl said to me are true. And also.. That I may once again regain the courage.. That the person I loved so much gave to me. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go. Now let's go out.
