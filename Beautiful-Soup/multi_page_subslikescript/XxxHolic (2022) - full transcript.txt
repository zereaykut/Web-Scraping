But no matter how bizarre events, people yearn to see them, want to interfere with them. The events are simple. Ay! Goat! Here's the bastard! But people - the most mysterious creatures in the world.

This is your fair payment. Do you need anything else? What a beauty! Would you like to see what happens to her? No. I don't see the point in this. I beg your pardon. Think carefully: what is the little finger responsible for? Dream? No, this is reality. [Attendant: Watanuki Kimihiro] And again, gray everyday life without a hint of communication. Didn't get hurt? And you Watanuki-kun? I am so sorry. Will you stand up? Same butterfly. Watanuki-kun? Wait, Watanuki-kun! Sorry. A fragrance from the new spring collection. Probe for you. Don't you want to? - Wonderful smell. - You're right. And for everyday use, and for officialdom. Suitable for any occasion. I have parties often, so it will come in handy. I also manage a company, just a lot of different situations. And for business, and for a party, and on dates it is quite suitable. But my boyfriend will scream. He is my doctor. And in general everything suits me, it’s just terrible. As soon as something is loved, everyone starts to imitate me. Ay… She felt. Proportional fee. “Oath on the little fingers. If I lie, I'll swallow a thousand needles! I swear by my finger." I've wanted to see you both for so long. And me too. Are you okay with the business guy? Yes, constantly abroad, but he writes to me every day. Ay… Something with a finger? No. It got so dirty. It's true. But why? Stop it. You are a liar. ...Misaki? "Misaki?!" Misaki! Shut up! Shut up! Wait! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! So you see it? This look. Ah, right. The kid about whom they gossip. What do you want to do with her? Fate is sealed. No matter how hard she resists, the result is the same. Yes, it's inevitable. Inevitably? The baby was born... Don't poke your head in there. Exactly. It's easier to take and die. My parents said that we would go to London together. Poor thing. True true. Your kindness is cruel. Honestly. It is better to accept your fate. The highest pleasure is to quit reasoning. What do you desire? Personally, I want these eyes. I want to eat them. If you want, go ahead. I do not need them. So it doesn't turn me on. If you eat it now, it won't taste good. Too easy to give up. Then eat it when it tastes good. Watanuki-kun. I'm sorry about yesterday. Domeki-kun took those printouts and… ...took it myself. When you flushed. Domeki-kun, apologize now. Otherwise Watanuki-kun will get angry. No I do not… Angry, right? I didn't even think about getting angry. Eh, that time... I, it... You're not angry, are you? Then let's make peace. Terribly sorry. What are you asking for forgiveness for? So it's all because of me. You are not guilty of anything. Hey, can we have some fun? Promise. Yes, I met the Spider-harlot. Who is she anyway? So, a person from whom sheer chores. Trouble? Did someone like you? It's because of her. And my eyes... When you get something, you need to pay. This is the law of this world. And yet it is so... You can't give too much away. You can't take too much. But… You want to stop seeing spirits. Is there any intention behind desire? Well… Something nice? Something oppressive? Haven't figured it out yet? For me this is the first time. Me For the first time together to have fun called. And I… And because of this I... Because of such simple events I want to live ordinary life. Do you have such thoughts? What are you doing? The world is not something that has already been created. You build it yourself. Find your pay. What for you really important thing? Exactly. I do... ...Morning! — Morning! Watanuki, get up! Mistress is in trouble! Yuuko-san... I drank… My head hurts. There is so want. - I want to eat so much! - I want to eat so much! Enjoy your meal! How delicious. How delicious. And really, it's so delicious. Didn't cook anything special. Warms up to the bone marrow. And you won't? I don't like feasts. Especially if he cooked himself. Let's help here. - There is. - There is. Here. Purely. Purely. Very good. Well, I'll go then. Oh, I have one request. What a sake lover. Sorry… Yes, I just wanted to ask. Should I take this road to Ryukoji Temple? Yes. At the next corner to the right and into the third lane... Can you walk me? Hello. Yeah. Watanuki-kun! Sorry for distracting. I wanted to see the inside of the temple. Let me? I beg. Thanks a lot. Of course, with my brother. No, I just showed you the way. I'll go. - Brother. - Yes? - Let's go to. - No, I... There will be something interesting. Tell me, is he cool? Domeki-kun. Haven't seen before? Domeki Ritual Bow. He aims at everything bad on earth and shoots an arrow there. Banishes all troubles in a year. The first of April at the Cherry Blossom Festival shoots. Wow. Did you want to see it? Yes. What it is? It seems that here my ancestors firmly locked various vices under lock and key. Various vices? Yes. Sometime in my childhood I was ordered not to look there for anything. When they say that, they want more. It seemed to me that an eye was watching me from the darkness. Learned about this story and came to see? Hobby is. I go to admire spiritual places, I listen to stories about monsters. When you face such an inexplicable horror, you realize the insignificance of humanity. I can't resist. Yeah. Weird hobby. Well, what about you? Do you have it hidden too? The best horror story in reserve. Hey… Come on. Tell. BUT? Do you want to share yourself? Don't be afraid. Tell. A very happy couple lived in a certain place. Himawari-chan... Continue. There were no troubles in their life together. And every day was filled with happiness. The couple had a child, and then they wished: “Let the happiness that we have he will get it, and the one who will become our child's half. Then the child grew up and found a soul mate. As their parents wished, they were able to live a happy life. And then what? Soon they got married, they also had a child. The newly minted parents prayed for him: "Let happiness accompany him just as we do." Here. And then? And then then out of nowhere came a voice. "It's impossible". "You and your ancestors squandered this child's luck pool." Such is the payment for their happiness. Pay? Here is such a story. Perfect. And this child lives for years, taking on the karma of his parents. Huddles in a circle of misfortunes, not knowing any joys. Truly a hopeless life with the desire to never be born! Shitty gripping story. No. Today is a rich harvest. Thank you. As a reward, I'll tell you something you don't know. There are many things in the world that cannot be seen. Of course, in their invisibility a special beauty. You don't know where they are. Can't touch. We call them ayakashi spirits. Most of all, ayakashi adore the weaknesses of human souls. In the end, everyone thinks only of themselves. And such invisible creatures that make fools die there must be hordes behind those gates. If a mere mortal opens them, all dangerous creatures will break out and make trouble. Or maybe Even the whole world will be destroyed. But if the gate is opened by the exorcist, he will consume all the ayakashi and they won't get out. Which means he gets in the way. This man. Wouldn't it be better to get rid of it first? Watanuki-kun?! Watanuki-kun! Hey Watanuki! Hey! In vain. It's not time to eat you yet. Here you go. You can't ask for anything. Yuuko-san... Dimensional Witch. She has a pretty face. As she told me. Another witch. Even though you're human, you're behaving badly. When she found me, she endowed me with her power. I will do whatever she wants. Say hello to her. Now go. Let's have fun another time, sister. Watanuki-kun! Sorry. Why are you apologizing again? I brought that psycho. Really sorry. B-it hurts. Get some sleep. Everything has already passed. I can go. Put me down And you're a noisy guy. You… Thanks to. Then we'll go on our own. Let's get there. We'd better go home... The shop is seen only by those who want the fulfillment of desires. Exorcist, your strength will surely become his strength. And vice versa. Everything that happens has a meaning. Where? How it is? A pleasant breeze is blowing. Yes. Better? Yes, it's gotten better. AND? Cheered up? Yes. For the first time in my life, my eyes were useful to someone. Here. Isn't that good? Helping each other without charging a fee was invented only by people. You look happy. Yuko-san. You were looking for a servant. May I stay here for a while? On-a start! Watanuki-kun, have lunch with us. Eat. Thank you. She needs well water. Better from an old well. And don't mess with the tap. Do you know about this? Know something I know but I have to eat. Great! Enjoy your meal! Delicious! And you're a funny guy. Well stop it! Shaggy! Everything is so beautiful! Enjoy your meal! Thanks to her, I feel so light again. I am ready to pay any price. I want to win by any means. If I get there, I will fulfill your every desire. I ask you to. Yuko-san isn't here right now, I'll tell her later. No! I wanted to give just for you. Well… Are you an omelet? Do you prefer sweet? Yes. So, did you find something important for yourself? Not yet. Maybe try an omelet? - Delicious! - Delicious! The festival is coming soon. Yes. Right now, he is very busy training with the ritual bow. He eats everything I bring, and immediately leaves. Domeki-kun? Yes. If so, it's a disaster. With Himawari-chan. What about Himawari-chan? Watanuki, you should have understood. Wait, Himawari-chan. Did I do something? No. So why? I'm sorry. Now Domeki-kun is not around. What do you mean? You should have understood. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. Yuko-san! Yuko-san. I want to save Himawari-chan! Have you seen it all the time too? That black haze swirling around Himawari-chan. When Domeki-kun is by her side, she holds back almost everything. Thanks to the gift of exorcism. Therefore, she communicates with you only when the three of you. So far, I've preferred not to notice anything. But now I want to intervene. Of course. After all, Himawari-chan herself understood everything. After all, she opened up in front of me. Now I'm different and I'll save her. With your help, Yuuko-san, I can do anything. The ancestral karma she inherited took root deeply. She was destined from birth not to experience happiness. And send misfortune to those who are close to her. This is the story she has to go with. But, Yuko-san, you grant wishes. The one who will pay for it an equal price. And if he wants to fulfill his desire. The price to pay for getting rid of that burden is very high. B-But you, Yuuko-san... I got it. Enough. I won't ask for your help. Himawari-chan! I will deliver you. Come with me! Not! But there is no need to hurt others. Watanuki! You can hurt yourself all you want. Watanuki-kun! I waited so long for it to be delicious. But if you die... I'm taking it. Are you awake? How… But I… Did you have a nightmare? Nightmare? Not… Not true. But… Ah, Yuuko-san... Would you like some fresh air? But I do... And the conversations after. How did it happen? It wasn't a nightmare at all. Hey guy! This is for me… Yuuko-san? Mother! Mother? Exactly. Ayakashi my mother... Mom, no! No not like this. Not! Run away! Not this way. Mom knocked down when she pushed me away. Mother. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Everything is before my eyes. And all because of them. Mother… There are things in the world that we cannot change. Just accept your fate. There is no point in arguing. Mother! Through my fault... I'm only just looked. Nobody could save her. Yuuko-san... What? I don't care what happens to me. I am only I don't want anyone to get hurt. Are you going to run away again? I don't run away... You still don't understand? How are the people you see hurt? When they turn away from others. What are you speaking about? When they stop talking. Reasoning won't change anything! If nothing changes, then there is no point in reaching out to people. Well, do as you please. With those who have ceased to reason, there is no longer any point in talking. Yet… Still, fate cannot be changed. Mrs... She is all right? Now you understand... Running away from life's difficulties is the most obvious solution. It's hard for you. Poor guy. Don't think about anything else. I will fulfill your every wish. Come to terms with what's happening. Everything is inevitable. I will tell you whatever you want. “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” - I'm here... - Good morning. It's a good weather today. Looks like it will be a great day. Yes. Now let's sit down for breakfast. Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. Good as it is now. What do you cook for dinner? You don't need dinner. Don't you have time? To the festival. Archery. Yes, but... Then so. For dinner, fried soba from the stall. It's all. OK. Here. Come on! Do you want strawberries? Or a banana? Everything is delicious. Hold. Thank you! Archery is being fired! Run-run! - Let's run! - Let's run! Oh Watanuki? Hello. Ah, popped in for Yuuko-san to buy. Tell me... I'll ask you a strange thing. I recently with Himawari-chan... How is it? I give. Probably still had a dream. “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. Yesterday you said the same thing. Is it? How about fried soba for dinner? Yes, it will. If it suits you, then me. What a nice weather though. Yes. Thank you! Archery is being fired! Run-run! - Let's run! - Let's run! I have never been to a festival before. It is nice here. Right. Again? It's your birthday. Yes, but you gave me yesterday? Yesterday? Though every day congratulate, I do not mind. And what happened yesterday? I also gave chocolate covered strawberries. What are you talking about? Today is the first of April, your birthday. Welcome back. Where's the fried soba? Yuko-san. What is today's date? April first. Your birthday. “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” “Watanuki, I want to eat so much!” Watanuki? Watanuki? Hello. Hey Hey. Same day - do you like it? Terrible, it's fun. As I ate your eye, my strength increased. Here in gratitude and fulfilled your desire. Ayakashi don't follow you anymore the days are filled with nothing but simple pleasures. Cool right? Don't talk about anything else. Just indulge in pleasure. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. Something happened? No. Now let's sit down for breakfast. Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. My wish… Ayakashi is not visible. Nothing happens. Nobody gets hurt. Everything goes according to plan. The same thing is repeated. You can stop talking. Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. So. So cool! Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. - Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Nice... - Delicious! - Nice... - Wow... Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! Today's omelet is just delicious. Thank you! Everything goes according to plan. The same thing is repeated. Ayakashi is not visible. Nothing happens. Nobody gets hurt. Enjoy your meal! - Delicious! - Delicious! “Today’s omelet is just delicious. - ...charm. No. So mine place here? Wait, Himawari-chan. The one who makes friends with me will certainly be haunted by misfortunes. So I move from city to city. Don't make that face. You won't write anything. There are destinies that cannot be fixed. But this… The world is so unfair to everyone. I felt good in this city. Near Domeki-kun. I even got used to nothing happening. Only still hurt Watanuki-kun. I'm sorry. Still, it wasn't a dream. Tell. What happened that day? Please. "Watanuki-kun!" — Watanuki! "Watanuki-kun!" — Watanuki! Watanuki-kun... ...Himawari-chan. - What? Sorry. I can't do anything... Stop talking. Don't say that, please. Watanuki... Hey! We didn't know what to do. In the head it became white-white. Watanuki-kun... She seemed to be saying, "Follow me." Come in. Only those who yearn for the fulfillment of a wish are shown a shop. And then we asked Watanuki-kun to get better. And everyone lived happily. Don't cheat! What really happened? Yes, it doesn't matter. How important! What's this? Me and Domeki-kun paid a fee. And he has same wounds? Domeki-kun... Now "caster" and "seer" are confused. What for? Why are you like this?! Why is all this for me?! Because I wanted to. Would you do the same for me? Or not? Don't make that face. We say goodbye to each other with a smile. Say goodbye? Lived here too long. I'm leaving town. Himawari-chan, I'm sorry. I'm glad I met you, Watanuki-kun. I'm sorry, Himawari-chan. Why are you apologizing again? If it all ends like this, if it brought only grief, “It would be better if we didn’t meet…” “It’s not true, Watanuki-kun! Nobody can be around forever. It's definitely time to say goodbye. But still I will always have memories of how we spent time together. For everything that was, sincere thanks. Himawari-chan. Himawari-chan! The only thing I can do love myself for who I am. May tomorrow be a good day. Farewell, Watanuki-kun. Crap! You're angry? It's my fault they're both... They are for me... What for? "You" is not only you. There is not a single thing in the world that would be in itself. In the world, everyone is connected with someone, everything is united by something. Any choice leads to innumerable options. And in a wonderful way they are interconnected. And then what do I... The future determines every choice you make. Because of the choice, fate can also change. I want get into the new tomorrow. You paid a fair amount. For the eternal repetition of the first of April. But the Whore Spider had to abandon you and put you here. But it can't be that she really refused. There is only one way to get out of the first of April. And this is to eliminate the root cause. How - the choice is yours. Should help you a little. Thanks a lot. Need your help. I can't do it alone. It's already here. Came here - and immediately remembered. The taste of your blood Why so scared? Let me out of this world! How, how. What are you carrying? You are so comfortable here, as if in the womb. You don’t decide anything, you don’t think about anything, you live protected from all sides. Not true. This is fake. Everything as you requested. You live without any noise. Just a smooth fade. Brilliantly. I'll get out of here. Very selfish of you. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry I hurt you. Or did you like it? Where will you choose? Like it here? Need more pain? Don't rip. Today you outdid yourself. Get out of here! Release! I don't like those screamers. Watanuki! Do not dare! I'm fine. Luckily… And he was such a sweetheart. Is this the power of the exorcist? Great! Run away, Domeki! Run away! OK. Let's have fun. Calm down, I won't kill you. Let's just play together. And in the morning the first of April will come again, and then you and your friends will be the same. Your idea is very good, but... Watanuki! Fate is sealed. And everything is inevitable. Domeki! Run away from here! Friendship is fun, right? I made a choice. Pretty boy. Domeki! Do you know why I made this world ring for you? Because you longed for it. And your strength is so great. Well? Fulfill another wish for you now? Special. But no one not a word. Stay here forever. Agree and I'll let the rest go. The first of April will be repeated for you alone. And I'll eat your remaining eye. Well? If there are no other options. Everyone will return. Only you will sacrifice yourself, but everyone will be saved. What do you think? I've been waiting for this for so long. Its end. It's already over. I finally realized. Sacrificing yourself to save people this is the biggest selfishness. If I get hurt, there will be people whose hearts will ache. You helped me figure it out. Thank you. What are you talking about? People will never change anything. Wrong! They do not change, but they are able to change! I hate it. You have always ruled everything by force. Looks like you found something important. Yuko-san. How much do you like the boy? I love sweet omelets much more. What the hell?! You look happy. Even if you save the boy, fate cannot be changed. He is destined to be eaten. It's all… …inevitably? Oh you! Yes, it's inevitable. Stop! — Let it. But… What I want - I want it badly! And if it can't be mine I will destroy this whole world! These gates were created by humans. Only they can open them. Which of the countless paths you go through - you choose for yourself. Fate is determined only by you. In vain. People are not that strong. Everyone lives without thinking. People and true stupid creatures. Yes, that is right. Are we going to be with you? I like you? Stop doing that! Charm! You can't stop me! I will eat all of humanity! Here's the stupid one. Yuko-san! Hey what's going on? The creatures sealed by your ancestors have come out into the light. Are we running away? It is forbidden. If they break through, they will plunge the world into chaos. Then what to do? I dont know. Only need to act! The time has come. For those who have existed since time immemorial. People need to participate in everything. The events are simple. Then I chose you Watanuki. Yuko-san. And you're a noisy guy. Let's go back to the original place. Yuko-san! Let's lock them up. Let's finish it all. Yuko-san? Yuko-san. Can you hear me? I still managed to get out of the fake world. But I couldn't save anyone. So nothing happened. At that moment I could only stand as a pillar, and Yuko-san sacrificed herself. And yet you changed Watanuki. Yuko-san. Even if nothing changed only by changing the point of view of the world, it is possible to change the destiny. You made a decision and took a step. You are now able to forgive and love yourself. Yuko-san. What? Yuuko-san... Please don't leave. I just… Just finally met you. All people meet prepared people when it is destined to meet. After all, everything… …inevitably. And the same with breakups. But you... But you fulfill wishes in this shop. I beg you. I'll give you a fair price! I do not want! I don't want that! I would like to fulfill this desire. Not, Yuk… Will you listen to my wish? Yuko-san, yours? My wish: for you to be in this world. That's all I want. Goodbye, Kimihiro. Enjoy your meal. There are many strange things in the world. But no matter how bizarre events, people yearn to see them, want to participate in them. The events are simple. But people - the most mysterious creatures in this world. Hello. Hello. So is it better? Is this the answer you chose? This is where I need to be. I will inherit the shop. After all, it is necessary. And me, and for those who don't know about it. Whatever you choose, once the choice is yours, then so be it. I chose too. There are no accidents in the world. Everything about it is inevitable. “Sir, you have a visitor. “Sir, you have a visitor. Come in. This is a wish fulfillment shop. So. What is your wish? [SEKAI NO OWARI-Habit] So much you need to share everyone at once By groups, differences, genres, by all means. Why should people divide themselves? It has become a habit Somehow it is. "There are only two kinds of people in this world." If you said so, then you are my target. There are those who own and those who do not own. There are those who do and those who don't. Yin? Is it yang? Until everyone is divided, It will not work out for them to stop worrying. Do not notice Decided that beyond the instincts. Don't want to know? Not in the mood? Actually, it's not that easy at all. Very delicate, ticklish and unclear entirely. For example, he owns, but does not suit him. And at least he does, but does not come out. He pretended to understand, and now he is cunning. “If only they didn’t open it,” he only cares. Here you are gifted with talent, And I was created as a housewife. But what's good here? More beautiful where else? Let's finish proving the impossible. I'm not asking you: "Let's dream." And don't be reckless. Just don't let the habit consume you.

Let's get rid of this bad habit! I confess what adults never admit: Reading notations is a pleasant horror. And they are the most delicious appetizer for beer, But also a push so that you take a step forward. Well, it is in its own way bash on bash, But in my opinion, it's a pity already: After all, initially it's up to you to decide, Yes, and how you do it, it's not interesting to me. "What should we do now?" “People want to know themselves. Not the end, I'll assume, But if I'm wrong, it's too late to correct. This is because you are sitting in ordinary boxes, where they are sorted into piles like this. My life flows in easy fashion forever half asleep, and I'm already under thirty. My abilities are initially frail, But I would break out, rush about and howl ugly. If you put me in a box at that moment, They would have figured it out for sure. Everything in this world is just about money And only in love, and only in kinship, and only in fate. Why is everything contained in two syllables? And with us, things are much more delicate, Much more complex and very obscure. Don't pretend you understand, don't be proud. Skills to identify yourself with someone Not at all.
